## Good to know

CodeRefinery is a training network around FAIR research software development. We usually offer two massive streamed interactive online workshops per year with instructors from within the team but also try to onboard new instructors from anywhere. You can find all information about how we do workshops in our [manuals](https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals). Many partners are also collaborate on additional workshops or hackathons. But CodeRefinery is not only workshops: It also is a community of people who enjoy helping others. In 2024 we also plan on doing more outreach, so if you are a social media guru or enjoy giving presentations in different forums, we would be delighted if you could help with that.
