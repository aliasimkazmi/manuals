# Team leaders

We use this page during team leader onboarding.
**Thanks for being a team leader :heart:**!
Without you, these large online workshops would not be possible.


## Onboarding session: Introduction, icebreaker, and project chat

We usually offer two one-hour timeslots in the week before the workshop (check
the schedule!) for team leader onboarding. You are expected to join one of
these times. During this time, we will talk about the role of the team
leader during the workshop and answer any open questions you may have. We will
also go through the material below.

* CodeRefinery: We are working with students, researchers, and research
  software engineers from all disciplines to advance FAIRness of software
  management and development practices so that research groups can
  collaboratively develop, review, discuss, test, share and reuse their codes.

* Get familiar with our collaborative document ({ref}`how-to-hackmd`)

* Shortly introduce yourself
    * Who are you?
    * What do you do?
    * Where are you connecting from?

* If you want to, sign up for our [Zulip chat](https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com) to ask us anything, anytime. Use
  `#tools-workshop` during the workshop itself (you need to join the stream).


## Reviewing learners survey

We used to ask learners to fill out a pre-workshop survey. This is discontinued
now but results of the surveys still apply.  Let's take a quick look at
previous courses survey results:
<https://github.com/coderefinery/pre-workshop-survey>


## What will happen during workshop?

Please review the workshop schedule on the main workshop page. It
contains links to lesson material and exercises.

**Interactive stream?**
* Instructor Zoom is streamed and recorded (watch material, watch demo, type along)
* Everyone follow stream during lessons
* Exercises during the lessons are done individually or in teams
* Everybody interacts via collaborative document


## Preparing for the workshop

As a team leader, we do not expect you to know all our [CodeRefinery training material](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) but if you have time:

- **Take a look at the exercises in advance** of each days (revised
  lessons tend to have an "exercise list" page).  We try to make each
  exercise self-explanatory so that you can easily lead, but if you do one
  thing, scan over the exercises and understand the general point of each of them.
- **Be ready to introduce yourself** in one or two sentences to your team: think about what you
  would like to convey as team leader to your group. How did (or does) CodeRefinery help you?
- If you are interested, also read through the **instructor guides** for the lessons (there should be
  a link at the top or sidebar of each lesson).


## Exercise sessions

* Instructor should clearly tell which exercises and for how long; if you don't know please clarify via collaborative document.

**Registrations**, Learners could sign up: 
* ... as team with a team lead
* ... as individuals, watching the stream and doing the exercises individually

**Make it easy for learners to ask for help**:
* Make sure your group knows that you are their team lead
* Encourage your team to also put answered questions in the collaborative document, someone else might be wondering the same thing.

**Want extra help?**
* It is ok to not know something!
* Use the collaborative document if
  there is questions that you cannot answer. Our instructors and expert helpers are watching it and try to answer every question.

## Your task during exercise sessions

As a team leader, your main task is to **keep people talking
and interacting, understand their difficulties, and encourage them to
work on the exercises together**.

- You can always start by **greeting** people and asking how the lesson is
  going
- If you meet virtually, encourage people to **turn on cameras**
- There are several strategies below.  Combine as needed - **read the
  room and see what they want**, but do **provide encouragement** to do
  something.
- **If you need extra help, ask for it in the collaborative document**, 
we have expert helpers available that will be able to answer fast.
- **Watch the time** and try to keep things moving.  If some debugging
  takes to long, it's reasonable to describe the problem in the collaborative document. An expert helper may have seen the problem before.
    - If any one problem takes too long, it's OK to say "we don't have
      time, let's come back"


## Strategies for leading a team

There are several strategies you can use to run your team, no matter if you meet in a physical or virtual room (Physical room would need a larger screen for every one to see though):

Strategy 1:
- **team leader asks someone to share the screen and go through the exercise.**
- You can encourage the others to guide the one who is sharing the
  screen. Or let the person go on her/his own pace.
  - If no one dares at first, you can also start sharing your screen and let the room tell you what to write.
  - That way they see how it can go and the barrier shrinks.
- Try to alternate who is sharing the screen for each session.
- When someone has an issue, it is a good idea to switch screen share to them
  and maybe even continue from there

Strategy 2:
- **Everyone does the exercises themselves, and once someone has a
  question, encourage them to share the screen and you discuss.**
- If everyone is active, this can be good, but there is a risk that no
  one starts off.

Strategy 3:
- **You can also share the screen if no one is willing to.**
- It might be good to give learners some lead first, and use this only
  if no one volunteers.


## Create a positive learning environment

As a team leader, you have a crucial role during workshops:

- Encourage learners to learn from each other.
- Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that people in your team will
  learn more working together.
- Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
  Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
  instructors. You are our eyes and ears.
- As we said, you don't have to know everything, just like learners don't
  necessarily know everything (we don't know everything, either). It's more
  important to be responsive and work together.
- If you meet virtually: Turn on your camera, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. Have an introductory round in the first exercise session, to get to know your group. Whichever strategy you choose for your team, be present and encourage learners to ask questions.
- In an in-person workshop: Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
  convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student's
  won't.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
  don't look ready.


## Common problems in teams

- **One learner asks very many questions**, ends up monopolizing all of
  the time.  Other learners are left without help, and the whole group
  may not get the exercises done
    - Encourage them to ask in the collaborative document
    - It can be very hard to say "no", but it's more important to have
      balance than answer every question you are asked.  If you need
      to say no, you can try things such as "I'm sorry, but in order
      to finish we need to go on now.  We can keep working on it
      later - would you like to watch?"
- There is some sort of problem that ends up taking a **lot of time**
    - Work on it for a minute or two.
    - Encourage to describe the problem in the collaborative document. Our expert helpers may be able to help.
      Nothing wrong with this.


## Code of Conduct

Teaching isn't about helping those who are already "in", it is for
those who aren't.  Thus, we follow [a code of
conduct](https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/) for all our
interactions before, during and after workshops.

If you see anything that is not supporting an equal learning environment,
please make us aware by sending a message to support@coderefinery.org . If the issue is not concerning a single person, and has influence on the learning experience for everyone, you can also mention it in the collaborative document. 


## Things to avoid

**Shorter version**:
* Take over learners keyboard, you can share commands via the collaborative document
* Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or learners who use them (Excel, Windows, etc.).
* Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. 
* Dive into complex or detailed technical discussions.
* Pretend to know more than you do. Better to put a question on the collaborative document then. Trust.
* Use "just", "easy", "simply", "basic", "trivial" or other demotivating words. 
* "I can’t believe you don’t know X" 

**Longer version**:
- Take over the learner's keyboard (neither physically nor remotely). It is rarely a good idea to type anything
  for your learners and it can be demotivating for the learner because it
  implies you don't think they can do it themselves or that you don't want to
  wait for them. It also wastes a valuable opportunity for them to develop muscle
  memory and other skills that are essential for independent work.  Instead, try
  to have a sticky note pad and pen / use the collaborative document and write the commands that they should type.
- Criticize certain programs, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
  learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)
- Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool. Regardless of its
  shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
  someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
  them.
- Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people
  in the audience who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
  at the workshop.
- Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you
  are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
  ask questions and seek help.
- Use “just”, “easy”, or other demotivating words. These signal to the learner
  that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
  they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.
- Feign surprise at learners not knowing something. Saying things like “I can't
  believe you don't know X” or “You've never heard of Y?” signals to the
  learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
  are teaching, that they don't belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
  from asking questions in the future.

## Background: hierarchical workshops to scale

Traditionally, a workshop has instructors and team leaders/helpers, but the
capacity is limited by instructors, so we are limited to ~30-40 people
at most.  Then, we tried to scale to larger numbers: even up to and beyond 100
people.  For this, we have to rely on *team leaders* . A team leader does not have to be an expert in the
material, but should be able to keep things flowing.

Team leaders are an essential part of the CodeRefinery workshop team and
allow CodeRefinery to scale to many more people than we could otherwise handle.
Team leaders will guide their team through the course, keep
time, and let us know when more help/time is needed during the exercise sessions.
Instructors and expert helpers are always available via the collaborative document. It is very
likely that you'll grow as a mentor and learn how to be a more efficient
teacher. 


## What is needed to be a team leader?

Most importantly, *you do not have to know everything* (we don't, either), but you are expected to:

- Have been to a CodeRefinery before and used git some since then, OR have some general experience with git (branching,
  pull requests) and command line work, OR be able to generally follow
  the path of the exercises that we have laid out.

- Be present in your teams physical/virtual room at least during exercise sessions of the workshop.

- Show a positive, motivating attitude to learners.

- Keep exercises going and let us know when there are difficult questions!

- Come to a one-hour "team leader onboarding" (see below) before the workshop.

> If you aren't sure if you can be a team leader: you probably can be one!


## Background: Teams

A team could be for example a
group colleagues/friends where one of the team members has a bit of knowledge
on the tools presented in the workhop. This person can act as team leader
for the workshop, but may still learn a thing or two themselves. In that way
you can work with people you know and the barrier for asking questions and
discuss together may be a bit lower than in a group of strangers. Since teams
with team leaders are 'self-sustaining' we usually accept all team
registrations.

Sometimes we also allow learners to register as invidual learner with interest in being in a team. We then try to arrange those people in teams which stay together for all exercise sessions on all days and provide a zoom breakoutroom with a team/exercise leader. Since this is dependent on our team leader capacities, we cannot accept infinte amount of learners. 
Being assigned a team as a learner allows people to form a bond and get the
rooms started sooner.  We will try to keep you in the same team
room as long as we can, but we give no promises and will rearrange as
needed when people can't attend. 


## Material for team leaders

If you have been to a CodeRefinery workshop before, you will most likely know the following, but if unsure, also check these links: 

- {ref}`Collaborative document mechanics <how-to-hackmd>`
- {ref}`how to attend via livestream
  <attend-stream>`

If you have any doubts, questions, ideas or anything you want to tell
us apart from these sessions, please let us know! We are here to help. 

If you want to contact us before the workshop you can send an email to our general email address <support@coderefinery.org> or you can join the
{doc}`CodeRefinery chat <chat>` (we recommend the `#workshops` stream,
and if you can't find it then `#general` is good). During the
workshop, we use a topic in `#workshop-chat` to coordinate (exercise
leaders do *not* need to use this, use the collaborative document instead).

During the workshop,  the collaborative document is our main communication channel, where you can ask questions or extra help in case of tricky technical questions or further discussion potential.

If you had fun being a team leader for the workshop, please visit our
{ref}`contributing page <volunteering>` page, to find out about further
volunteering possibilities within CodeRefinery.
