<span id="attend-stream"></span><h2>Attending an livestream workshop<a class="headerlink" href="#attending-an-livestream-workshop" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We are glad you would like to attend an livestream workshop.  This page
will help you prepare and get the most out of the workshop and take
advantage of the diverse ways to attend.</p>
<p>Even though it’s a one-to-many livestream, the course is still
interactive.  In fact, it’s more interactive, since everyone can Q&amp;A
at the same time via <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-hackmd-mechanics"><span class="doc">Notes Doc</span></a>.  Since we can
record without privacy risk, you are better able to catch up and
review.  Read on to learn more.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You might register to Zoom breakout rooms, which <em>are</em> interactive.</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-hackmd-mechanics"><span class="doc">Notes</span></a> allows you to ask questions anonymously -
even better than a normal workshop!  Once we have a few tens of people in
any workshop, people don’t ask voice questions anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>In some workshops, you can register for breakout rooms to get
interactive assistance during the exercise/breakout sessions.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="how-it-works">
<h3>How it works<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-works" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You open the livestream in a web browser.  This is the “TV”, it is
always on (but sometimes silent).</p></li>
<li><p>If you are part of an exercise/breakout group, be with them.  The
stream will tell you when the exercise/collaboration times are, and
you go to there.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are attending Zoom exercise session, open this at the
beginning.  Leave it minimized when it’s not active.</p></li>
<li><p>If you are with an in-person group, be together.  When the stream
is quiet, you can interact freely.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The livestream is a portrait screenshare, so that it will only take
up half of your screen (and the other half is for you to work).  (If
you are in a physical meeting room with a projector or second
monitor, it can be half the livestream and half the Notes - this
will make sense when you see it).</p></li>

<div class="section" id="general-prerequisites-software-installation-etc">
<h3>General prerequisites, software installation, etc.<a class="headerlink" href="#general-prerequisites-software-installation-etc" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Check your workshop page for the general setup specific to that
workshop.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Often, there is something to install on your own computer.  (We
usually ask you to set up your own computer, so you can continue
working independently later.)</p></li>
<li><p>There may be some basic skills, such as the command line shell, to
review in advance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do the installation and configuration in advance, and double check
it.</strong>  Our instructions are standard enough that someone local should
be able to help you, if some central install help isn’t provided.  The
livestream can’t wait for individual people (but a local group can
provide live support).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="take-the-workshop-seriously">
<h3>Take the workshop seriously<a class="headerlink" href="#take-the-workshop-seriously" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>It’s easy to think “it’s just online, it’s easy to passively watch”.
And that is OK!  We’d rather have someone watch in case it might be
useful, than exclude people who don’t have time.  Our material is
available for later.  In this case, please don’t register for our
Zoom/in-person sessions, since that can take a spot from others.</p>
<p>However, we design the workshops to be interactive, and there is a lot
of time scheduled for hands-on work and Q&amp;A.  Reading this page and
preparing will help you to make the most of it: <em>don’t do multiple
meetings</em>, <em>reserve the entire timeslots on your calendar</em>, <em>attend
every session</em>, <em>do the preparation</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="social">
<h3>Social<a class="headerlink" href="#social" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Attend with someone!  Register together and try to be in their same
group.  You could even reserve a room and work together.  This will
create a network of learning and practice that will last much longer.</p>
<p>If you can attend a group, that is even better.  You can bring your
own team leader to guide you (if the workshop works this way).  Research
shows that groups that have multiple adopters have much more uptake of
new skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="workspace">
<h3>Workspace<a class="headerlink" href="#workspace" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Get a good, quiet workspace.  Make sure it is comfortable enough to
stay at for a while.</p>
<p>An extra monitor is useful but not required, since there is a lot of
stuff to follow: the stream itself, the lesson webpage, and the window
where you are doing the assignment.  You could also use a second
device to watch the stream.  However, we do design things to fit on
one computer.</p>
<p>If you have registered to attend breakout rooms, you’ll be expected
to talk at some times and take part, not simply be
quiet and listen all the time.  Try to be in a place where you can
speak without disturbing others.  By the same token, you’ll be
listening for a long time, and your ears may get tired of headphones.
If you have good enough external speakers, be somewhere that you can
use them (perhaps only sometimes - when it doesn’t interfere with your
microphone.)</p>
<p>If you work in a large office, consider attending from home or in a
meeting room so that you can speak and listen more freely.  If you
need and extra monitor or more comfortable seating space and don’t
have that at home, consider working at your office.  Yes, these are
conflicting ideas, you need to find what works best for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-management">
<h3>Time management<a class="headerlink" href="#time-management" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Paying attention to something requires time, whether it is online or
in-person.</p>
<p>Don’t schedule overlapping meetings, reserve the entire timeslots,
minimize distractions.  It’s easy to think you can do multiple things
at once when doing it online, but really it’s a trap.</p>
<p>Plan to join the stream 10 minutes early to get ready - we start with
icebreakers and discussion then.</p>
<p>There will be breaks, but even long ones go by very fast, and this
gives you limited time to make coffee, eat, etc.  We try to limit
ourselves to half-days because of this, but consider preparing food,
coffee, etc. in advance.</p>
<p>Make sure you take the breaks, walk around some, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="accessibility">
<h3>Accessibility<a class="headerlink" href="#accessibility" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We believe that livestream workshops offer a wide variety of tools
which are useful to allow everyone to succeed.  Consider how you want
to attend to make it the best for you:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Our material is provided in writing (lesson websites), by voice, and
by demo.  You don’t have to strictly follow along at the speed we
teach.</p></li>
<li><p>We record videos and post the notes so you can review at your own
pace later on. Videos don’t include audience voice or video, so you
don’t have to be afraid to interact.</p></li>
<li><p>Notes Q&amp;A allows anyone to ask questions anonymously and
asynchronously, without interrupting others. On the other hand,
there are a <em>lot</em> of questions, so don’t watch too closely if it is
distracting.  We continue answering questions for a little bit after
each day ends, so you can ask even if you can’t write the question
on time.</p></li>
<li><p>Lesson websites/Notes use standard web technologies, so that
browser accessibility plugins can be used (for example making the
font more accessible, check browser extensions).</p></li>
<li><p>Twitch can be live-captioned using the Google Chrome browser.  Our
videos on YouTube provide automatic captions immediately, since
videos are released immediately they don’t come too late for you.
Other standard browser extensions can also provide other video
accessibility services without asking us.</p></li>
<li><p>You can follow along without providing any personal data
(registration, Twitch works with cookies blocked) - though
registration helps our reporting.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="communication">
<h3>Communication<a class="headerlink" href="#communication" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Most communication goes through <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-hackmd-mechanics"><span class="doc std std-doc">Notes</span></a>. Make sure
that you open it and try it out during the icebreakers - it will
become obvious then.  There will be an absolute flood of information
there, so watch strategically and don’t let yourself get overloaded.</p>
<p>Notes is much better than chat, since you can ask <em>anonymously</em>, you
can ask <em>at the same time as others</em>, and <em>multiple people can
answer</em>, and <em>we fix it up and publish it at the end</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-notes">
<h3>Final notes<a class="headerlink" href="#final-notes" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Join the stream 10 minutes in advance.  There is some advance
icebreakers and discussion you can take part in, and you get to breath
before we start.</p>
<p>There is usually discussion after the workshop.  If you want, stick
around and give us immediate feedback and ask more questions.</p>

<p>Our workshops are interactive and hands-on, and you will get the most
out of them if you can take part in all exercises, unlike a normal
academic lecture where you mainly listen.  Thus, please read this and
come prepared!</p>
<div class="section" id="general-prerequisites-software-installation-etc">
<h3>General prerequisites, software installation, etc.<a class="headerlink" href="#general-prerequisites-software-installation-etc" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Check your workshop page for the general setup specific to that
workshop.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Often, there is something to install.  We usually ask you to install
things so that your computer is set up to do work later.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be some basic skills, such as the command line shell, to
review in advance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If all else fails, join the workshop well in advance and ask
for help then.  Usually, there will be enough time to get ready for
the day.</p>

<div class="section" id="take-the-workshop-seriously">
<h3>Take the workshop seriously<a class="headerlink" href="#take-the-workshop-seriously" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>It’s easy to think “it’s just a class, it’s easy to passively watch”.
However, for an interactive workshop you do need to take part to get
the most of out it, and our workshops are targeted to that.  If you
read this page and the workshop prerequisites, you should be OK.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="social">
<h3>Social<a class="headerlink" href="#social" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Attend with someone!  Register together and try to sit near them.
This will create a network of learning and practice that will last
much longer.</p>
<p>If you can attend a group, that is even better.  You can bring your
own team leader to guide you (if the workshop works this way).  Research
shows that groups that have multiple adopters have much more uptake of
new skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="computer-and-equipment">
<h3>Computer and equipment<a class="headerlink" href="#computer-and-equipment" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Bring your laptop and charger, of course.  If you use external mice,
etc, it would be good to bring them too.  You’ll be on your device a
lot.</p>
<p>Usually, you’ll need to look at both the lesson webpage and the window
where you are doing the exercises at the same time.  Consider how you
can arrange windows to do this best.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="time-management">
<h3>Time management<a class="headerlink" href="#time-management" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Try your very best to attend the whole workshops; at least don’t miss
the early sessions.  Later sessions depend on earlier ones, and it’s
easy to get behind.  Tell others this is important so that you can
free your schedule.</p>
<p>Arrive 10 minutes early to get ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-notes">
<h3>Final notes<a class="headerlink" href="#final-notes" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Arrive 10 minutes in advance to get set-up.  There is some advance
icebreakers and discussion you can take part in, and you get to breath
before we start.</p>
<p>There is usually discussion after the workshop.  If you want, stick
around and give us immediate feedback and ask more questions.</p>

<p>Since we plan to publish the questions and answers later as part

your own name to make it easier to discuss more during the workshop but
then always use this form: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[name=Myname]</span></code>. This makes it easier for
us to automatically remove all names before publishing the notes.</p>
<p>Other hints:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+1</span></code> to agree with a statement or question (we are more likely
to comment on it).</p></li>
<li><p>Please leave some blank lines at the bottom</p></li>
<li><p>NOTE: Please don’t “select all”, it highlights for everyone and adds a
risk of losing data (there are periodic backups, but not instant).</p></li>
<li><p>It can be quite demanding to follow the collaborative document closely.  Keep an eye
on it, but consider how distracted you may get from the course.  For
things beyond the scope of the course, we may come back and answer

<h2>Roles overview<a class="headerlink" href="#roles-overview" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>CodeRefinery has been able to scale online workshops while maintaining
an interactive feeling. This page describes the roles that we use in our workshops.</p>
<p>Despite the many different roles documented here, <strong>in practice many
of them are occupied by the same people</strong>.
<a class="reference internal" href="#best-practices"><span class="std std-ref">Best practices</span></a> below tells more about what tends to happen.
One of the advantages of our large workshops is that we have many more
staff on hand (often 10-15), thus allowing much more specialization
than small workshop can have (thus, the large number of roles below).
Many of our instructors give feedback such as “this is so much easier:
we only show up and teach!”</p>
<p>A common pathway goes (Learner/team leader) → (Expert
helper/Instructor) → (More specialized roles).  <strong>Note that thanks to
our <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-team-teaching"><span class="doc">team teaching or “co-teaching”</span></a>, it is really easy to join as
an instructor!</strong></p>

<p>We try our best to be very explicit about what is going on.
Your first goal should be to make sure the learners are engaged and no one is left behind.</p>
<p>The instructors should clearly tell which exercises and for how long (we try to
make all exercise sessions at least 20 minutes long).  If anything is unclear
please ask via collaborative document, you are our safety net.</p>
<p><strong>Make it easy for learners to ask for help</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure your group knows your name and that you are their team lead.</p></li>
<li><p>Always start by greeting people and ask how the lesson is going; report back if there is something instructors should be aware of.</p></li>

<li><p>It is OK to not know something!</p></li>
<li><p>Use the collaborative document if there is questions that you cannot answer.

<p><strong>Major problems?</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Exercise time is limited, watch the time and keep things moving.</p></li>
<li><p>If some debugging takes to long, it’s reasonable to describe the problem in the

<li><p><strong>Take a look at the exercises in advance</strong> of each day (the exercise

shows everything), check that you understand the general point of each of
them.</p></li>

<li><p>If you are interested, also read through the <strong>instructor guides</strong> for the lessons (there is a link at the top or sidebar of each lesson).</p></li>

<h3>How to create a positive learning environment?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-create-a-positive-learning-environment" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>As a team leader, you have a crucial role during workshops:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You are between the learners and the organizers and instructors, please use the collaborative document to communicate.</p></li>
<li><p>Encourage learners to learn from each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge that some of the material can be difficult and that people in your team will
learn more working together.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge when learners are confused and raise it to the instructors.
Understanding why learners are confused provides useful feedback for
instructors. You are our eyes and ears.</p></li>
<li><p>As we said, you don’t have to know everything, just like learners don’t
necessarily know everything (we don’t know everything, either). It’s more
important to be responsive and work together.</p></li>
<li><p>If you meet virtually: Turn on your camera, and encourage everyone else to do so as well. Have an introductory round in the first exercise session, to get to know your group. Whichever strategy you choose for your team, be present and encourage learners to ask questions.</p></li>
<li><p>In an in-person workshop: Stand up and walk around, try to make rounds by everyone.  If you are
convenient, students will ask.  If you are sitting in the back, student’s
won’t.  Students rarely try to get your attention from across the room if you
don’t look ready.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="what-we-want-to-avoid">
<h3>What we want to avoid<a class="headerlink" href="#what-we-want-to-avoid" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Take over the learner’s keyboard</strong> (neither physically nor remotely).
Instead, try
to have a sticky note pad and pen / use the collaborative document and write the commands that they should type.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Criticize certain programs</strong>, operating systems, or GUI applications, or
learners who use them. (Excel, Windows, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Talk contemptuously or with scorn about any tool</strong>. Regardless of its
shortcomings, many of your learners may be using that tool. Convincing
someone to change their practices is much harder when they think you disdain
them.</p></li>
<li><p>Dive into <strong>complex or detailed technical discussion</strong> with the one or two people
in the audience/team who have advanced knowledge and may not actually need to be
at the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pretend to know more than you do</strong>. People will actually trust you more if you
are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to
ask questions and seek help.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Use “just”, “easy”, “simply”, or other demotivating words</strong>. These signal to the learner
that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that
they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feign surprise</strong> at learners not knowing something.
“You’ve really never heard of (sometool)?” signals to the
learner that they do not have some required pre-knowledge of the material you
are teaching, that they don’t belong at the workshop, and it may prevent them
from asking questions in the future.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="strategies-for-leading-a-team">
<h3>Strategies for leading a team<a class="headerlink" href="#strategies-for-leading-a-team" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There are several strategies you can use to run your team, no matter if you meet in a physical or virtual room (Physical room would need a larger screen for every one to see though):</p>
<p>Strategy 1:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Everyone does the exercises themselves until someone has a question</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Encourage learners to ask multiple times; if necessary share your/learners screen and discuss.</p></li>
<li><p>If everyone is active, this can be good, but there is a risk that the barrier for disturbing the silence is too big.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>To start things off, team leader can share the screen.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Do not try to hide mistakes (they make good learning opportunities, “can you spot my mistake?”) and discuss your solutions.</p></li>
<li><p>It might be good to give learners some lead first, and use this only
if no one volunteers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Strategy 2:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Team leader asks someone to share the screen and go through the exercise.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>You can encourage the others to guide the one who is sharing the
screen. Or let the person go on her/his own pace.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If no one dares at first, you can also start sharing your screen and let the room tell you what to write.</p></li>
<li><p>That way they see how it can go and the barrier shrinks.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to alternate who is sharing the screen for each session.</p></li>
<li><p>When someone has an issue, it is a good idea to switch screen share to them
and maybe even continue from there</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You don’t actually <em>have</em> to do the exercises</strong>.  You could apply
lesson material to your own team’s work, review what was just said,
have a free-form discussion, etc. - if those are more valuable.  You
can always come back to exercises later, or let learners do them as homework.</p>

<h3>How to solve common problems in teams?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-solve-common-problems-in-teams" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>One learner asks very many questions</strong>, ends up monopolizing all of
the time.  Other learners are left without help, and the whole group
may not get the exercises done</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Encourage them to ask in the collaborative document</p></li>
<li><p>It can be very hard to say “no”, but it’s more important to have
balance than answer every question you are asked.  If you need
to say no, you can try things such as “I’m sorry, but in order
to finish we need to go on now.  We can keep working on it
later - would you like to watch?”</p></li>

<div class="section" id="more-background-about-scaling-workshops">
<h3>More background about scaling workshops<a class="headerlink" href="#more-background-about-scaling-workshops" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Traditionally, a workshop has instructors and team leaders/helpers, but the
capacity is limited by instructors, so we are limited to ~30-40 people
at most.  Then, we tried to scale to larger numbers: even up to and beyond 100
people.  For this, we have to rely on <em>team leaders</em> . A team leader does not have to be an expert in the
material, but should be able to keep things flowing.</p>
<p>Team leaders are an essential part of the CodeRefinery workshop team and
allow CodeRefinery to scale to many more people than we could otherwise handle.
Team leaders will guide their team through the course, keep
time, and let us know when more help/time is needed during the exercise sessions.
Instructors and expert helpers are always available via the collaborative document. It is very
likely that you’ll grow as a mentor and learn how to be a more efficient
teacher.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="more-background-about-teams">
<h3>More background about teams<a class="headerlink" href="#more-background-about-teams" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>A team could be for example a
group of colleagues/friends where one of the team members has a bit of knowledge
on the tools presented in the workshop. This person can act as team leader
for the workshop, but may still learn a thing or two themselves. In that way
you can work with people you know and the barrier for asking questions and
discuss together may be a bit lower than in a group of strangers.</p>
<p>Sometimes we also allow learners to register as individual learner with
interest in being in a team. We then try to arrange those people in teams which
stay together for all exercise sessions on all days and provide a zoom breakout
room with a team/exercise leader. Since this is dependent on our team leader
capacities, we cannot accept infinite amount of learners.
Being assigned a team as a learner allows people to form a bond and get the
rooms started sooner.  We will try to keep you in the same team
room as long as we can, but we give no promises and will rearrange as
needed when people can’t attend.</p>

<h4>Basic setup<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-setup" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>In a livestreamed CodeRefinery workshop, we have two types of learners: Active learners attending in Zoom and passive learners watching the stream.
Learners from both groups will watch the stream from their own browser and have the possibility to interact with the instructors and ask questions via HackMD
(a collaborative note taking tool: <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-hackmd-mechanics"><span class="doc">Collaborative document mechanics and controls</span></a>).
Active, registered learners will additionally get interactive help in Zoom breakoutrooms during exercise sessions.
Learners on stream can either form private groups or do the exercises on their own.
Following our team teaching strategy, your are never alone as an instructor. While you are teaching, you can fully focus on the task at hand, your co-instructor will watch the chat and HackMD and relay all important information to you.</p>

<h4>Why livestream?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-livestream" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>A livestream workshop allows us to reach an unlimited number of people, at the cost of not being as interactive as in classroom/zoom room.
However, we have had great experiences with the following strategy:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>HackMD as collaborative note-taking tool allows learners to ask questions anonymously and everyone can answer these questions asynchronously.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners can register to join Zoom breakout rooms, which are interactive and team leaders can help with any questions during exercise sessions and breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Learners can also form private breakout rooms or meet in person and watch the stream and do exercises together.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While the full livestream setup is a bit complicated, you as an instructor do not have to worry about anything but your teaching.
We have setup the whole system in a way that only active instructors are shown in stream, which makes video postproduction faster.
What makes our setup different from your ‘usual zoom class’ is that our instructors Zoom room that you are in while instructing is completely separate from the learners, while providing interaction possibility via HackMD.</p>

<li><p>The audience can’t directly talk with you (but when there is a large
audience, who does anyway?).  Instead, always say things like “What
do you think?  Write in the HackMD. [proceed to screenshare it and
discuss answers]”</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t need to worry much about managing the audience.  Others do
this and relay information as you need.  You should pay more
attention to HackMD.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="basic-meeting-setup">
<h4>Basic meeting setup<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-meeting-setup" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>There is an “instructor Zoom meeting”.  There are no students here,
and everything can and will be captured, recorded, published, and
livestreamed.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In the call are instructors, the Zoom host, and possibly some other
helpers who might occasionally comment.</p></li>
<li><p>The cameras of instructors are captured via Zoom gallery view.
This is show as both a “teacher view” as well as “overlay on
screenshare”.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have your camera off, you will <em>not</em> appear in the stream.
So turn your camera off when you are in the instructor meeting but
not presenting.  Ask others, but in principle it is fine to join,
stay hidden, and interact when relevant.</p></li>
<li><p>During the breaks/exercise times, the livestream itself (via OBS)
gets <em>muted</em> and <em>switched to another scene</em>.  So, you are free to
unmute, talk, and chat with other instructors.  This is a great way
to relax and prepare for the next segments!  This actually lowers
the pressure to pre-plan every part in advance.</p></li>
<li><p>By the same token, you can join the meeting during the previous
break to get all set up.</p></li>
<li><p>Zulipchat serves as the overall connection between the different
parts of the course and instructor backchannel.  This is the least

check).</p></li>

<div class="section" id="screensharing">
<h4>Screensharing<a class="headerlink" href="#screensharing" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>You can share your screen normally via Zoom.  The livestream is fixed
to an aspect ratio of 840 pixels wide × 1080 pixels high (this is so
that the learner has half of their screen available).  <strong>You can not
do a full landscape live-coding follow-along screenshare (nor is this
good practice in other workshops).</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In <strong>Zoom</strong>, you can either share one window or Advanced → Share a
portion of the screen → move the overlay to a portrait view.  Don’t
worry about making it exactly 840×1080, OBS automatically fits it
and we can adjust it during the setup time.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a landscape presentation (as opposed to live coding),
just share your whole screen, and the OBS operator will scale things
properly if it doesn’t automatically work.  Note that the 4:3 aspect
ratio is better than 16:9, but that usually has black bars on the
side.  This can be removed via OBS.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t stop screenshare unexpectedly - wait for the broadcaster to
switch to gallery view.  <strong>If you stop screenshare unexpectedly, the
stream reverts to someone picture full-screen.</strong>  Because of Zoom
“dual-monitor mode”, sharing screen does not prevent the gallery
from showing.</p></li>

<h4>HackMD and audience feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#hackmd-and-audience-feedback" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>HackMD (or similar document-based things) is our preferred
communication system.  The biggest problem is that it is <em>too</em> useful,
and too many people ask questions, which will easily overload you.  To
solve this, we have co-teachers (non-typer can watch HackMD), HackMD
helpers (watch and answer basic questions).</p>
<p>There are several general strategies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Occasionally screenshare the HackMD.  This emphasizes to the
audience that questions there <em>do</em> get noticed.</p></li>
<li><p>Rely on other helpers to answer most questions.</p></li>
<li><p>During Q&amp;A time, go to the HackMD and comment on the most important
questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Call on co-teachers, “do we have any good questions from HackMD?”</p></li>
<li><p>Co-teachers should be more than willing to interrupt with relevant
questions right away.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You can’t use Zoom polls and so on.  Instead, use HackMD cleverly.

</div>
<p>We can’t claim to know the best way to do this yet, but we have seen ways
that work and don’t work.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that you want to keep a constant <em>conversation</em>
going.  This can be a mutual discussion, one person explaining big
concepts and one the details, one person asking
questions and the other answering, or some other combination.  <em>This
is different that two people teaching different sections.</em></p>
<p>There is less need for the instructors to prepare every single thing,
since you can rely
on the wisdom of the group to get you through areas you haven’t
perfectly prepared.  In fact, this is good, because then your learners will
see things go slightly wrong and your live debugging.
Still it can be useful to agree with your co-instructor on the choreography
of your session (more about this below).</p>

<p>As the quote says, in any large enough operation, multiple people are
involved, but responsibilities should be clear.  At least, the team

in gaps by asking relevant questions, and tries to comment to the
presenter when things are going off track.  The interviewer “has the

<p>This is closer to normal teaching, so feels more natural to do.  The
big disadvantage is that it’s the tendency of the presenter to keep

<p>With more than one person, there is a risk of seeming uncoordinated
when the team doesn’t know who is supposed to move the lesson forward.
It’s not bad to have short discussions to decide what to do next, it
makes the show seem interactive.  But if it happens too
much, it becomes noticeable.  As quoted above, you could adopt a
principle which exists
in many domains: at any time, only one person is
in control.  Implemented in team teaching, it becomes: <em>you explicitly
know who is in control</em> (the <strong>director</strong>).  <em>The director is
responsible for understanding the current situation and checking with other
instructors, but in when you just need to something and no one has
strong opinions, you don’t debate, the director decides.</em>  The main
difference of Model 1 and Model 2 above is “is the director the one
mainly explaining new material, or the one asking questions”.  There
are also multiple layers of director: there may be the director for
the whole course, and the director/”conn” for the lesson.</p>
<p>We can’t tell you what works best for you.  But the models above and
thinking about who the director is should let you have an efficient
discussion to decide your model.  The need for a director is why we
don’t recommend fully equal co-teachers.  Instead, divide the course
into parts and use the two models for each part.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Of course, there are other roles in a workshop.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>HackMD watcher</strong> pays particular attention to the audience
questions.  They might be a different person from the co-teachers
and they can interrupt anytime.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Meeting host</strong> manages the meeting itself.</p></li>
<li><p>The Director could be completely separate from the people on
screen, and somehow sending signals to the teachers as needed.
But, unlike scripted media, the course reacts more to the audience
and it is better for the director to be in the lecture.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If you ever go off-plan, that’s OK.  You can discuss during the
lecture so the audience can know what you are doing and why.  You
<em>want</em> to adjust to the audience more than you would in a solo
course.  But at the same time, be wary of deviating too much from
the material that the watchers have, since it will be disorienting.</p></li>
<li><p>Two people works well.  With three, it’s hard to allow everyone to
speak equally and people tend to jump on top of each other in the
gaps - or no one talks, to give others a chance to say something.
You could have particular segments where different pairs of
people adopt the main roles, and others speak up if they want.  Or,
at that point, make it a panel discussion format (multiple
presenters and one interviewer)</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, it helps to have a good plan of what you are going to
do.  But if only one person knows that plan, this strategy can still
work, especially if that person is the presenter in model 2.</p></li>
<li><p>The less preparation you have, the more useful it is to strictly
define the roles of each person (to ensure someone is in charge of
moving it forward).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please send us more suggestions to add to this list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preparation">
<h4>Preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#preparation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>This is one proposed model for preparing for team teaching:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Talk with your co-teacher.  These hints assume a two-person team.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide what material will be covered, overall timing, strategy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Divide up the material.  In each section, decide the model to use
and roles.  If in doubt, starting with the guide/demo-giver division
with the stronger instructor as guide works well.</p></li>
<li><p>Decide who will be the director for each part.  Perhaps a good idea
is to keep it consistent: the guide is always the director.</p></li>
<li><p>At least one person prepares the outline (the order of topics to be
presented, key questions to ask, etc.) - usually the guide or
interviewer.  The guide or interviewer
should be comfortable with it (and could even do it mostly alone),
everyone can give comments and make sure to read it at least once.</p></li>
<li><p>Run as above.</p></li>
<li><p>You don’t need to plan every step in detail but it can be useful to prepare
the session together and step through the choreography (e.g. “now I will show
this and then give you the screen and then ask you to do this … you will
lead this 20 minute block and then I will lead that 20 minute block and
please ask me questions while I present X”).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Then, just go!  Don’t worry if it’s not perfect, if either person
wonders what to do next, just pause some or ask the other.  This
imperfection is what makes it more dynamic and exciting, and in almost
all cases the audience has been impressed with the co-teaching
strategy, even if it’s not perfect.</p>

answers of a multiple choice question.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t touch the learner’s keyboard!  This is very hard to do, since
it’s only natural to want to get things done quickly.  The best idea
we have is to have a pen and sticky notes, when it’s hard to spell

explain what happened since this can offer valuable insights to learners.</p></li>

Of course it is good to react to questions and to adapt the material to the audience, so sometimes an excursion can be very useful,
but make clear that you then deviate from the script
and be explicit about whether participants should follow what you do or only watch.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to show some extra steps in the terminal, show them perhaps at the end of an exercise block to not

<p>Appearance matters.  When you look at other professionally made videos

<h4>Audio<a class="headerlink" href="#audio" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Audio quality, and balance between instructors, is <em>absolutely
critical</em> to good online work, especially teaching.  Consider the
following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Can you adjust your microphone volume from very low to
higher-than-needed?  Make sure your dynamic range is larger than
“barely working”, so that you have some room to adjust for later.</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have a high-quality headset?  A headset with microphone is
the most reliable, but if you can get a desktop setup working
well, that can be good too.  Always have a high-quality headset for
backup anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a bluetooth headset, consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Bluetooth headsets have significant latency compared to wired or
purpose-built wireless protocols like gaming headsets have.</p></li>
<li><p>The microphone might not have enough bandwidth (if it’s part of
the same headset).</p></li>
<li><p>Bluetooth 5 is much better in both latency and quality.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider investing (or getting your work to invest in) some
high-quality headset or desktop audio gear.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>“Ducking” is when the first words are silenced/quieted by noise
cancellation, until it detects speaking.  To avoid this, don’t use
“high” noise cancellation (as low as possible is better, reduce
environmental noise / use headset mic instead).  If you
need high cancellation because of background noise, switch to your
headset.</p></li>
<li><p>Set your microphone’s hardware volume to something relatively high -
and control via the software.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="screen-sharing">
<h4>Screen sharing<a class="headerlink" href="#screen-sharing" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>You have to assume the smallest screen from learners and plan for
that.  You should share a <strong>portrait</strong> screen: either a portion of
your screen, or one window in portrait mode.  See the examples below.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Learners have a small screen, and need room for their own terminals
and web browser open, too.  A big screen or multiple monitors is
the special case.</p></li>
<li><p>Sharing a 1920x1080 screen is not a good idea: you need to make all
the text size large so that learners can scale it down to have room
to do their work.  Pixels are wasted.  <strong>Instead, force yourself to
save space by using a normal font size but sharing less of your
screen.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Zoom now has a “share portion of screen” (Screen sharing → Advanced
→ Share a portion of the screen).</p></li>
<li><p>For livestreaming, our aspect ration is 840×1080 (<strong>portrait</strong>).
This is a bit less than half your screen.  This is 43% of the width
of your screen and the full height, for a standard FullHD screen.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When streaming/recording: <strong>Never stop sharing a screen, ask someone
else to take it over</strong>.
There is a chance that the view goes to “gallery view” in the
recording or stream, which makes video editing harder or disrupts
learner privacy.</p>

<p>Here is one possible pathway from learner to (whatever else).  This is
an <em>idea</em> for a pathway but by no means a requirement - you can join
at whatever step you like, and steps don’t have to happen in order.
Maybe you are interested in some or the other.  There are also roles
completely outside of this pathway.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>After being a learner, you come back as an team leader/helper.</p></li>
<li><p>When you have a solid understanding of all materials, you may join
as an expert helper.</p></li>
<li><p>You begin co-teaching episodes with someone else</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We find that co-teaching is a good way to start.  In this, there
are two people, one person assumes the big-picture discussion, and
the other the typing and explaining what they are doing.  By
making the lesson a discussion instead of a lecture, it’s more
dynamic.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Eventually, you get confident enough to teach yourself (though
really we should always be co-teaching…)</p></li>
<li><p>Somewhere in there (before or after instructor, depending on your
interests), you may want to try to be a HackMD helper or Zoom host.
These are more about coordinating all the other people involved in
the workshop.</p></li>
</ul>

want.</p>

<p>The dream of interactive teaching is hard to achieve: most audiences
are very quiet and even if someone does speak up, it is a small
fraction of the audience.  We have found a better way: Build the
interaction straight in to the course by co-teaching.  Instead of
trying to have a conversation with students, we have a conversation
among co-instructors.</p>
<p>Co-teaching provides other benefits, such as easier preparation and
easier presentation.</p>

<p>We have developed several ways of team teaching, but for starters we
suggest the “guide and demo-giver” approach.  The <strong>guide</strong> manages
the overall flow through the lesson.  The <strong>demo-giver</strong> does the
typing during the demonstrations.  So, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The guide introduces a type-along session and walks through the
steps while…</p></li>
<li><p>… the demo-giver does the typing in the screenshare</p></li>
<li><p>The guide and demo-giver ask each other about what is happening.</p></li>

<p>During other times, the demo-giver and guide ask each other questions
when the other is talking.</p>

</div>
<p>Keep it formatted well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>(*) Tag names you see with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[name=XXX]</span></code> so that we can remove it
later.</p></li>
<li><p>Heading level <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">#</span></code> is only the page title</p></li>
<li><p>Add a new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">##</span></code> heading when a new <em>lesson</em> or similar thing is
started (introduction, icebreaker, break between lessons, etc)</p></li>
<li><p>Add a new <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">###</span></code> heading when a new <em>episode</em>, <em>exercise</em>, <em>break</em>
(within exercise session)</p></li>
<li><p>Ensure people are asking questions at the bottom, direct them there
if they aren’t.</p></li>
<li><p>(*) Ensure each question is a bullet point.  Each answer or follow-up
should be a bullet point below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Should you use more deeply nested bullet points, or have only one
level below the initial question?  It depends on the context, but
if a conversation goes on too long, try not to let it go too
deep.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Update with meta-talk, so that learners can follow along easily:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Add Icebreaker and introductory material of the day.  Try to talk to
people as they joined to get them to open HackMD and answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Anything important for following along should not be only said via
voice.  It needs to be in the HackMD, too.</p></li>
<li><p>New lessons or episodes, with links to them.</p></li>
<li><p>For exercises, link to exercise and add the duration, end time,
goals.  If these are unclear, bring it up to the instructor by voice.</p></li>
<li><p>Add a status display about breaks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Screenshare it when necessary:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>During breaks and other times, share the HackMD (including the
notification about break, and when it ends).</p></li>
<li><p>It is nice if the arrangement allows some of the latest questions to
be seen, so people are reminded to ask there.</p></li>
<li><p>Someone else may do this, but should make sure it happens.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer questions</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If there is an question that should be answered by the instructor by
voice, bring it up (by voice) to the instructor immediately.</p></li>
<li><p>During breakout sessions, watch for HackMD notifications about
breakout rooms that need help
and direct someone to that room.</p></li>
<li><p>How soon do you answer questions? Two points of view:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Answer questions right away: can be really intense to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait some so that we don’t overload learners: reduces the info
flow.  But then do people need to check back more often.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to find your own balance.  Maybe a quick answer right
away, and more detailed later.  Or delay answers during the most
important parts of the lecture.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Avoid wall-of-text answers.  If reading an answer takes too long, it
puts the person (and other people who even try to read it) behind
even more by taking up valuable mental energy.  If an answer needs a
wall of text, consider these alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Progressive bullet points getting more detailed (first ones
useful alone for basic cases)</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be worried to say “don’t worry about this now, let’s talk
later.”</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out the root problem instead of answering every possible
interpretation</p></li>
<li><p>Declare it advanced and that you will come back later.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ensure it can be posted quickly:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>HackMD gets posted to the workshop webpage.  For this, it needs some
minimal amount of formatting (it doesn’t need to be perfect, just
not horrible).</p></li>
<li><p>All names and private information needs to be stripped.  This is why
you should rigorously tag all names with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[name=XXX]</span></code> so they can be
removed (see above).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Learner names can be completely removed.  CR staff names can be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[name=CR]</span></code> or something similar.</p></li>
<li><p>There may be other private URLs at the top or bottom.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>If possible, send the PR adding the HackMD to the workshop webpage
(though others can do this, too).</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Expert helpers<a class="headerlink" href="#expert-helpers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We mainly have expert helpers for large workshops.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>As an expert helper, your main job is to move between different
groups and make sure that groups are doing well.</p></li>
<li><p>You might be summoned to a group whose helper needs extra help, or
take the place of a helper if a group doesn’t have one.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Watch HackMD/Zulip for this, though requests might come in from
other channels, too.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>No one is expected to know everything, but an expert helper should be
able to find a person who can answer, or confident enough to say
they should move on.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure you have a new (newer than 15 october 2020) Zoom client,
so that you can join arbitrary breakout rooms.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you don’t, then you have to ask to be put into some room, and
then you can swap to any other room.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Report an overview of the pulse of the breakout rooms in zulipchat
(or hackmd).  Is everyone behind?  People finishing early?  Big
differences between them?  Questions which we should bring up in the
main room?</p></li>
<li><p>Monitor if any team leaders need extra help or training.  Should we
improve our team leader training?</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="tasks">
<h3>Tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#tasks" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There’s not much difference between a team leader and expert helper, but we
envision this role standing by and jumping into rooms when there’s a
difficult problem.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Sometimes, you wait around for a problem that needs your attention.
But it’s better to be proactive and go into the rooms yourself and
check them out.  Talk to the organizers/instructors to see which you
should do.</p></li>
<li><p>You aren’t assigned to particular breakout room, but <strong>you can
switch between them</strong> (but it’s not obvious how):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To do this, you <em>do</em> get assigned into one room initially.  Join
that room.  <em>After</em> you are in the room, click on “Breakout
Rooms”, and then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Join</span></code> to switch to a different room of your
choice.</p></li>
<li><p>You also always have the option “Leave breakout room” (if in a
room) or “Join your assigned room” (if in main room and assigned
one).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Your role is to switch between breakout rooms and check up on them.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>e.g. join room 1, take a look/ask how it is, then join room 2,
then 3, then back to 1, and repeat.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, stay in one longer, if it’s needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a note of any important questions to be asked in the main
room afterwards.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to divide up the breakout rooms between the staff, and try to
join and catch up with the same rooms (this promotes familiarity).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>E.g. A rotates between rooms 1-3, B gets rooms 4-7, C gets rooms
8-11.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Make sure to watch the HackMD for expert helper requests</strong>, this could help
you decide which room to jump to next.  Comment when you are heading
there.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Concrete example for an expert helper’s time:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>I join breakout room 5 randomly.  I spend 15 seconds watching, then
ask if things are going OK.  If everything is good, I move on within
a minute since I am not needed (if there is a good break, I’ll ask
“everything OK?  good, see you around.”).  If there are questions
that I can help with, I answer them.  If they seem to be struggling,
then I will make a note in the HackMD and stay a while longer and
watch/help.</p></li>

<p>The registration coordinator is responsible for the Indico registration page and the workshop homepage.
Usually the registration coordinator has the best position for sending emails. Drafting can be collaborated with outreach and marketing coordinator.
They keep and eye on the Helpdesk before, during and after every workshop and make sure everyone is registered and knows where to go.
After the workshop, they make sure the CodeRefinery webpage is up-to-date and all changes needed in the planning HackMD are ported to the template.
The registration coordinator also has the overview over statistics for reporting and adds those to the webpage after the workshop.</p>

makes things smooth.</p>
<p>The Director is usually the instructor coordinator, so knows the
schedule well.  The instructor should be empowered to decide (after
checking chat, HackMD, and other instructors) what to do, and can
directly announce the new schedule.  This takes confidence, but don’t
worry: you have plenty of people to consult with, ask advice from
those around and then make your choice.</p>
<p>You should also make sure that HackMD is updated with breaks,
exercises, and so on.  You will probably be the one sharing HackMD
during the breaks.</p>

<h3>Switching scenes and audio<a class="headerlink" href="#switching-scenes-and-audio" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>During a livestream course, various video inputs are mixed
(screenshare, instructor gallery, title card, HackMD) and
broadcasted.  This gives one extra level of management that is needed:
yes, it is more overhead, but the advantages are that the instructors
can mute the livestream and have a private discussion.  This is great
for breaks and exercise times, and really helps with the flow a lot.</p>
<p>So, for example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Start the course on the “title card”</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to gallery view for introduction</p></li>
<li><p>Switch to screenshare (and adjust PiP size) during teaching</p></li>
<li><p>Share HackMD during the break and then make PiP size zero</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat for next courses.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The available controls include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Audio: the audio capture can be turned on and off:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Instructors”: the capture of the Zoom</p></li>
<li><p>“Mic”: this is the <em>local microphone</em> of the capture computer and
should not normally be adjusted.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Scene selection: there is a button to select among these scenes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Title card”: graphics used before learners arrive</p></li>
<li><p>“Gallery”: instructors</p></li>
<li><p>“Screenshare”: capture of the Zoom screenshare</p></li>
<li><p>“Hackmd”: just what it says</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="sidebar">

<h2>Broadcaster<a class="headerlink" href="#broadcaster" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This page explains the setup and how-to guide for the OBS broadcaster.
This person manages the technical setup of <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-obs"><span class="doc">OBS</span></a> and thus
the streaming.  This person often is, but does not have to be, the OBS
director [todo: link] who switches the scenes and manages the
broadcast after it has started.</p>
<div class="section" id="role-of-the-broadcaster">
<h3>Role of the broadcaster<a class="headerlink" href="#role-of-the-broadcaster" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>As the broadcaster, you manage the OBS application that captures Zoom
and sends it to the world.  This is different from:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>Director</strong> manages the scenes and the overall flow of the
workshop (switches scenes, cues instructors when to start talking,
shares HackMD during the breaks).  This person is often the
broadcaster, but for clarity we use more precise terms.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Host</strong> is the interface between the instructors and the
audience: e.g. announcing instructors, keeping to the schedule,
etc.).  They are very often the same as the Director.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>Instructors</strong> connect to Zoom and teach.  If there is no
designated director, at least one instructor needs to know a bit
about that.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The broadcaster has a lot of preparation work to do the first time
they get set up (future courses aren’t so bad).  They should expect
some panicked fixing of stuff right before each course starts.  During
the courses themselves, the broadcaster is mainly sitting back making
sure nothing breaks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-setup">
<h3>Initial setup<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-setup" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Prerequisites:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A somewhat powerful computer dedicated for broadcasting (not used
for teaching as an instructor, the broadcaster <em>can</em> use an
instructor computer, but that is much more complicated).</p></li>
<li><p>Stable internet connection (speed is not too important these days).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>20/5 download/upload Mbps is probably plenty good.  100/10 Mbps is
far more than is needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Wired connections, rather than wireless, are better (WiFi,
non-cellular uplink).  However, you probably know your overall
stability the best: you want a continuous, smooth connection
without much <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter#Packet_jitter_in_computer_networks">jitter</a>.
However, OBS settings can be tuned to have a larger buffer to
handle this.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Software installation:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://obsproject.com/">Install OBS</a> (Linux, Mac, Windows -
this is a mass market product so there is good support)</p></li>
<li><p>Install <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/">obs-websocket</a>.  This is also
fairly widespread, but slightly less so than OBS.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom (but you likely already have that)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Zoom setup:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Install Zoom.  There’s not much you need to do differently.</p></li>
<li><p>Some Zoom settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>General → Use dual monitors → yes.  Despite the name, this gives
Zoom two <em>windows</em>: one for the gallery view, one for the
screenshare (or active speaker if there is no screenshare).</p></li>
<li><p>General → Enter full screen automatically when starting or joining
a meeting → false</p></li>
<li><p>Screen Share → Enter full screen when a participant shares screen
→ false (important)</p></li>
<li><p>Screen Share → Scale to fit shared content to Zoom window → true.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OBS setup:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clone the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/coderefinery/obs-scenes">obs-scenes repository</a>.  This contains some
pre-made scenes which will set your OBS up for teaching nicely.</p></li>
<li><p>Import the TeachingStreaming profile
(Profile → Import → <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">obs-scenes/profiles/Teaching_Streaming</span></code>).  This contains things
like audio and encoder settings</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>TODO: this may need adjustment for your particular situation.  At
least things like file paths will need to be adjusted.  Look at
the obs-scenes readme for more information.</p></li>
<li><p>Most importantly, this sets it to 840 horizontal × 1080 vertical
(portrait mode).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Import the Teaching_Streaming_ZoomCapture scene collection (Scene
Collection → Import →
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">obs-scenes/scenes/Teaching_Streaming_ZoomCapture</span></code>).</p></li>
<li><p>You now need to configure some window captures, for example, you
need to tell OBS which window has the gallery of all instructors in
it.  From the “Scenes”</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Scene <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_GalleryCapture[hidden]</span></code> → source <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ZoomMeeting-Gallery</span></code>
right click → Properties → Window → select the Zoom gallery view
(for me it is titled “Zoom meeting”).  TODO: adjust the size of
this window until it fits the pre-made scene [it looks nice and
large]</p></li>
<li><p>Scene <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_Screenshare-Zoom-Capture[hidden]</span></code> → source
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Zoom-SecondWindow</span></code> right click → Properties → Window → select
the Zoom screenshare/active speaker window (for me it is titled
only “Zoom”).  Adjust the size of this window until it nicely
fills the preview pane (the ideal size is 840×1080).</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Scene <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_Hackmd-Capture[hidden]</span></code>: similar, select the
shared HackMD</p></li>
<li><p>(optional) Scene <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_Broadcaster-Screen[hidden]</span></code>: configure your
local desktop capture.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Configure the audio</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Settings → Audio → Desktop Audio → “Default” (or if you want,
select an explicit device).  This is what will capture Zoom by
monitoring your speakers/headphones.</p>
<p>Note: prevent audio feedback!  Be careful if you set this to
speakers, and you have a separate computer which you use for
teaching with a microphone that would hear those speakers: you
would get feedback.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Settings → Audio → Mic/Aux Audio → “Default” (or whatever device
you want).  This would capture that computer’s local microphone,
if you use it.  (More likely, you would join the meeting as an
instructor, and thus use a separate computer to speak to people)</p></li>
<li><p>From the main OBS scene, rename the audio devices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bottom panel → Audio mixer → one of the devices → gear icon →
Rename →</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Desktop capture to “Instructors”</p></li>
<li><p>Mic to “BroadcasterMic”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Configure obs-websocket (set the listening socket + authentication).</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tools → Websocket server settings → {Enable websockets
server=true, Server port=(something), Enable authentication=true,
Password=something}.  Share your IP address, server port, and
password with your other instructors.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Allow outside connections.  On of these two:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use <a class="reference external" href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok</a> to forward the connection
(including SSL).  Read more from the obs-websocket documentation:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/4.x-current/SSL-TUNNELLING.md">https://github.com/obsproject/obs-websocket/blob/4.x-current/SSL-TUNNELLING.md</a>
.  Note that the free plan limits to 4 simultaneous connections
and the connection information will change every time you restart,
which is not great.</p></li>
<li><p>Configure your router/firewall to allow incoming connections to you
IP address, on the port configured above.  (it is this external IP
address that you need to share with other instructors.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Internet connection goes down</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>OBS crashes</strong> While this happens somewhat often during testing,
during live productions, when the settings are not being changed, it
has never been observed.  Set all settings in advance, and maybe
quit and restart right before starting the broadcast.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Audio is capturing the wrong inputs, or audio quality is bad</strong></p>
<p>So once when broadcasting, the audio quality was horrible.  It
turned out that the sound system got confused and the desktop audio
capture (zoom capture) was actually capturing the microphone.  This
was <em>not</em> reflected in the OBS settings.</p>
<p>To solve this, go to the OBS settings (you can adjust most, but not
all, settings while a stream/recording is ongoing).  Flip the audio
devices to “disabled”, then back to what it should be (possibly you
need to save in between?).</p>
<p>It’s possible there are other times you need to adjust the audio.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>I have HackMD open in view mode (to share) and HackMD open in edit
mode (to edit), but OBS keeps switching to share the editable
one</strong>.  OBS seems to go by window title.  Try this: Use a different
browser, or run one of them in private mode (so that the title is
different).</p></li>

<p>It’s our standard to have these videos on YouTube by the same evening

explore themselves, and that means they need guides to help them if
they get stuck.</p>
<p>We recommend that each site takes proactive steps to recruit at least
two helpers per workshop.  We’ve noticed that helper diversity
promotes learning, so we recommend that organizers also make proactive
steps to have diverse helpers (male/female, international, etc.).
Local organizers should directly contact possible helpers and invite them.</p>

<p>Dear Professor X,</p>
<p>My name is NAME and I work as a XXX in YYY. I’m contacting you now to spread the word about a workshop which I am co-organizing in LOCATION together with the CodeRefinery project (http://coderefinery.org/) organized under the NeIC organization. I found your contact information via ZZZ…</p>
<p>CodeRefinery (http://coderefinery.org) aims to reach out to diverse academic communities which use and develop software in their research, and advocate more modern and efficient software development methods (such as collaborative distributed version control, automated testing, code documentation, managing code complexity, etc). CodeRefinery is not about efficient code, but rather efficient coding, and experience has shown that researchers have a lot to gain from our course material!</p>
<p>A CodeRefinery workshop is planned for LOCATION in CITY on DATE, see the website here: URL</p>
<p>The most natural audience for our workshops is PhD students and postdocs, but both more junior and senior people may find it valuable to attend.</p>

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Engage as a tutor on the CodeRefinery online workshop, Nov 17-19 and 24-26,
9:00-12:00

Engage in the successful CodeRefinery workshop program, by becoming a tutor for
the exercise sessions and discussion groups.  If you have been to a
CodeRefinery workshop, you will have experienced  a very hands-on approach to
training with frequent exercise sessions and group discussions.  In online
workshops these sessions take place in breakout rooms with 5-7 participants and
1-2 workshop tutors.  Tutors answer questions from the learners, guide them
through the exercises and try to keep time.  If needed, tutors can call on
experienced trainers in the background to help answer tricky questions.  The
tutors are an important part of the CodeRefinery teaching concept and all the
workshops to scale to many more people than the instructors could  otherwise
manage!

If you have previously attended a CodeRefinery workshop, and/or use some of the
tools and methods covered in a workshop (Git, software testing, modern
documentation platforms etc.), then please consider joining a CodeRefinery
workshop as a tutor! Being a tutor is fun, it expands your network and develops
your teaching and mentoring skills.  You always learn something new about a
subject by teaching it!

If you would like to help on the upcoming workshop in November, please sign up
as a tutor on https://coderefinery.github.io/2020-11-17-online/.  If you would
like to engage in later workshops, please register as a tutor on the notify-me
form (https://indico.neic.no/event/135/surveys/36).

Dear CodeRefinery alumnus,

We hope that you enjoyed participating in a CodeRefinery workshop last semester and that it was 
beneficial for your work and research! We don’t keep an attendance list, so apologies to those 
of you who couldn&#39;t make it to the workshop...

Please help us to improve our course material and teaching methods by answering our very brief questionnaire at 
https://indico.neic.no/event/109/
about whether and how the CodeRefinery workshop affected how you develop code. 
All information you provide will be useful. Your participation is extremely valuable 
and will help us to develop the project further. The average time to fill the form is around 5 minutes.

Would you be interested in being a helper or instructor in future workshops? It&#39;s a great way to continue 
developing your skills and expanding your network! We&#39;re always interested in recruiting new helpers 
and instructors. If this sounds interesting to you, please get in touch by writing to 
support@coderefinery.org or join our chat: https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com

On behalf of the CodeRefinery team,
Thor

<h5>Practical info (online)<a class="headerlink" href="#practical-info-online" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h5>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>The online CodeRefinery workshop TITLE is approaching! It will take place on DATE at START - END in Zoom room ZOOMID.
On the first day, we also have an optional session starting half an hour before START where you can connect,
test your video client and iron out any technical issues (we recommend attending this if you haven’t used Zoom before).</p>
<p>If it turns out that you cannot attend, please let us know as soon as possible so that we can offer your seat to someone on the waiting list.</p>
<p>We will be using a Zoom room with ID ZOOMID. We recommend that you install the Zoom client (https://zoom.us/download).
In order to join the room you will need the password ZOOMPASSWORD.
You will be encouraged (but not forced) to use a webcam during the workshop.
If you don’t want the physical room you’re in to be visible on the webcam, Zoom allows users to set up a virtual background:
https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background
You might also be asked to share your screen during group exercises or in interactions with a workshop helper.
Remember to keep private information away from the screen you share!</p>
<p>You are expected to install some software on your computers before the workshop starts.
Please visit the workshop webpage WORKSHOPURL and go through each tool under “Software requirements”,
and install whatever you’re missing before the workshop starts. Note that you also need to create some accounts.
Note that each of these tools/accounts can easily be removed/deactivated after the workshop, if you so wish (see https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/accounts/).</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to get in touch (support&#64;coderefinery.org) if you run into any installation problems or have questions relating
to Zoom or other practical details. Note that we maintain a list of common installation issues that can occur at https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/troubleshooting/</p>
<p>If you haven’t already filled the pre-workshop survey, please do that soon since it helps us with workshop preparation.
You can find it at: SURVEYURL.</p>
<p>The workshop will be very focused on version control with Git. Some of you are already familiar with Git, but not all.
While we will be starting from the basics, we will be progressing quickly so it’s useful if you spend a few minutes to read up on the basic idea of Git.
For this purpose, we have prepared this “refresher” material: https://coderefinery.github.io/git-refresher/
Note that this material also contains important Git configuration steps which all of you should go through before the workshop starts, to save valuable time during the workshop.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery strives to follow a Code of Conduct. Please have a look at
https://coderefinery.org/about/code-of-conduct/ so that we all are aware of how to treat each other respectfully.</p>

<li><p><strong>Filename</strong>: you don’t need the full filename but indicate what

<li><p><strong>Start</strong>, <strong>end</strong>: start time of the segment</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Segments to cut</strong>: Segments which should be cut out.  Don’t be

<li><p>How small should segments be?  First, it’s better for videos to exist
than be perfect, so the 3-hour segment is better than nothing.  Short
lessons (1.5 hour) are probably fine to be at once, and long ones (git
intro/collab) could possibly be each episode separately.  Discuss with
others to see what you would like.</p></li>
<li><p>Ideally, there are two videos from each day: one recorded by Twitch
(raw dump of the stream), and one recorded by OBS/Zoom (local

<p>The purpose of this page is to give video processing volunteers a
starting point.  (It also has some hints for workshop organizers).</p>
<p>For some of our online lessons, we release videos on YouTube.  This is
not necessarily for brand new people to watch and learn the material
(though they may), but especially for people who attended the workshop
to review what they saw.  As such, it’s more important to get them
published fast, than make them perfect.</p>
<div class="section" id="what-we-want">
<h4>What we want<a class="headerlink" href="#what-we-want" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Our workshops consist of lectures, demo, and exercises in breakout
rooms.  We record the main Zoom room, and also livestream the main
room via Twitch.  We would like the video of the workshop to be
processed so that it can be released on YouTube.  This should not be a
major production: it is more useful to those who want to review what
they saw in person, rather than a new person watching.</p>
<p>We will provide the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Raw video files (probably two copies one recorded from Zoom and one
from Twitch - so there is a backup.)</p></li>
<li><p>List of lessons (= final videos) and which raw files contain them
and when.</p></li>
<li><p>List of instructors</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We want out:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>One processed video file per lesson.</p></li>
<li><p>With irrelevant breaks removed.</p></li>
<li><p>Without any video from learners.  We use Zoom so that learners
should not appear in the stream, but we can’t be sure it works so
this needs to be checked.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The rough process is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Load up the right video files in the editor.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the start of the lesson (hint: look for a change of
instructor - ask us if you need help!) and cut off the stuff before.</p></li>
<li><p>Watch through the videos.  Most of the lecture parts are fairly
standard and can be fast-forwarded through (it’s rare for a
learner’s picture to appear here).</p></li>
<li><p>Cut out the idle time during breaks.</p></li>
<li><p>In exercise sessions, learners go to breakout rooms, which are not
recorded.  This part can be cut out, <em>but</em> sometimes the instructor
stays in the main room to do the exercises for the stream.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be too precise.  We aren’t trying to make a masterpiece to end
all masterpieces, but a something for those who were at the workshop
to refer back to.  So:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Imprecise start/stop/break times are fine</p></li>
<li><p>Other random off-topic chat is fine</p></li>
<li><p>Voices of learners is fine and expected</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Video</strong> of learners is <strong>not ok</strong> (really, this is the only
thing that needs care).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Before/during/immediately after the workshop<a class="headerlink" href="#before-during-immediately-after-the-workshop" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>From day 1, advertise that “the workshop may be recorded and put on
YouTube.  We will prevent any pictures and names from going there,
but your voice may be.  Please don’t include your name in hackmd
unless you accept it may be published.  We support your right to be
anonymous in this workshop.”</p></li>
<li><p>Same announcement at the start of the workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>Record in zoom.  Note: when you start the recording, make sure that
someone is currently sharing the screen, <em>and</em> the screen is a good
size (e.g. normal Full HD, as opposed to some vertical shape).  The
dimensions when the sharing first starts determines the dimensions
for the entire course.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediately after workshop, go to Twitch and download the raw
streamed version.  You have to be logged in as the channel, then the
option is naturally provided to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose some standard, shared place and immediately upload videos
there.  Recommended naming scheme:</p>

<div class="section" id="processing">
<h4>Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#processing" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Processing principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Remove any participant videos, if they accidentally make it into
the video file</strong>.  This is really the only serious rule in the
processing, if we didn’t have to check this we could just upload the
raw ones and it would be good enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Create one final video per lesson in the workshop</p></li>
<li><p>Work incrementally, upload processed ones when you can, get quick
feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If it’s not clear, the course organizers will provide a list of the
lessons (final outputs) and the respective inputs (which source files
go into it).</p>
<p>You can generally:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Use some video editor</p>
<ul>
<li><p>iMovie on Mac</p></li>
<li><p>OpenShot is a simple cross-platform editor (<a class="reference external" href="https://cdn.openshot.org/static/files/user-guide/quick_tutorial.html">tutorial</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>(please give more ideas here)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>(so far, this is not a general “how to edit video” guide… you will
need to find one for your editing program)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a new project for the output (e.g. the Jupyter lesson)</p></li>
<li><p>Import the raw video files which contain Jupyter (e.g. day 4).  If
one lesson is split over multiple files, combine them.</p></li>
<li><p>Cut off the part before and after the lesson itself (saving
frequently).  You’ll have to figure out the start and end times,
this may be hard when there are several files.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin watching the lesson.  Look for the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Break time?  Exercise session with irrelevant stuff in the video?
Cut the time out.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Any non-instructors pictures in the stream?</strong>  Cut it out.
Sometimes you might need to blank the picture while</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be too perfectionist - the goal is to get something done,
not maek the perfect videos.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Export the videos with a high quality, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jupyter.mp4</span></code>.  It
will go to YouTube which will render lower resolutions, so you don’t
need to worry about this so much.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the videos to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">processed</span></code> subdirectory of the google
drive.  Do this immediately, video by video.  It’s better to get
continuous feedback on this.  You are done!</p></li>

<h2>Online teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#online-teaching" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In 2020, we were forced to start teaching online.  Is this good or
bad?</p>
<p>The promise of the Internet was that we could reach everyone in the
world.  Instead, we immediately learned to hide or Zoom links from
anyone except the people who register in advance to hide from trolls.
We directly translate in-person to online, and wonder why we don’t
have as much engagement.  It doesn’t have to be this way.
CodeRefinery has developed a vision of this teaching that can take the
best of both worlds.</p>

<div class="section" id="what-is-different-about-online">
<h3>What is different about online?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-different-about-online" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Online teaching requires a certain mindset.</p>
<p>First off, it is <em>different</em>, and different is not better or worse.
You must rethink your existing assumptions and design for the current world.</p>
<p>Some differences in mindset include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the material is online, why pay attention <em>now</em>.  Why not find
the same or similar material when you need it?  If the course isn’t
online, still you realize you can do a web search and find something
equivalent later.</p></li>
<li><p>Why <em>dedicate</em> myself to this now?  Why night attend a course
passively now, get the basics, and come back later when I need to
really understand something?</p></li>
<li><p>How to best use the tools?  I might have only one screen to take the
course (and no projector to watch), but the instructor material is
also closer.  Why type things myself, if my normal work is copying
from StackOverflow anyway?</p></li>
<li><p>Related to the above, you can’t use attendance as a proxy for
engagement.  You have to actually engage people, or accept that
passive attendees are OK.  Do you measure the benefit of people
watching the course later?</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone knows how to way of attending in-person courses.  But there
are different ways to attend online courses, and you don’t get as
much feedback from others.  You need to be <em>explicit</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Once you learn to take advantage of online formats, you might never go
back!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="taxonomy-of-online-teaching">
<h3>Taxonomy of online teaching<a class="headerlink" href="#taxonomy-of-online-teaching" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This isn’t a strict division, but here is a rough vision of steps to
take, from simplest to more advanced.</p>
<div class="section" id="by-yourself-in-a-meeting">
<h4>(1) By yourself, in a meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#by-yourself-in-a-meeting" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>It’s you and a group of students in a meeting (e.g. Zoom).  This can
reach people, but it’s easy to lose the attention of attendees.
Because you need to avoid trolls and protect privacy, you may have a
private registration and you may not publish recordings.  This gives
limited usefulness in the future.</p>
<p>Key aspects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Set up a good screen share (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-instructor-tech-online"><span class="doc">Instructor technical setup, online</span></a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Be explicit on how to attend.  Plan for not only attention during
the course but something that has a lasting usefulness.</p></li>
<li><p>Possibly use HackMD for discussions/questions

<h4>(2a) Group teaching, in a meeting<a class="headerlink" href="#a-group-teaching-in-a-meeting" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>One of the advantages of online teaching is it doesn’t require
full-time physical attendance, so you can more easily bring in a
diverse set of helpers, which greatly reduces your load.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Definitely use HackMD instead of chat (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-hackmd-mechanics"><span class="doc">Collaborative document mechanics and controls</span></a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Separate roles more, so that the instructor only needs to focus on
teaching.  Other helpers can come and go or attend part-time.

<li><p>Expert helpers, helping students</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom host</p></li>
<li><p>HackMD watcher</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the same time, you can start grouping learners together into small
groups.  This is the equivalent of different tables in a physical
workshop.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Zoom breakout rooms can group people together</p></li>
<li><p>You need to be explicit about how the groups work.  Even in person,
many learners work independently even when forced into a group.</p></li>
<li><p>Add “team leaders” (helpers, former students) to guide each
group.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="b-higher-production-values">
<h4>(2b) Higher production values<a class="headerlink" href="#b-higher-production-values" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Now we reach the real promise of online teaching: by using streaming
platforms, you can reach everyone in the world.  No registration is
needed and anyone can take part.  The disadvantage is that you don’t
have close interaction with the learners (by design: removing these
close interactions how you can accept everyone).</p>
<p>This focuses on technical setup</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>OBS Studio for producing good recordings/stream (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-obs"><span class="doc">Open Broadcaster Software theory</span></a>)</p></li>

<li><p>Make videos available (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-video-editor"><span class="doc">Video editor</span></a>)</p></li>

<p>Finally, we get to our final state: You can combine the contradictory
options: privacy for learners, but anyone can attend.  Interactive
course, but people can refer to it later.</p>
<p>This is more a mindset thing, and combines everything from above.</p>

<h3>Technical setup summary<a class="headerlink" href="#technical-setup-summary" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We have a public broadcast, with goes out via a livestream.
Disconnected from this, people are watching the broadcast in a
<em>separate</em> Zoom meeting and doing exercises/breakouts there.  Or,
people can watch via the livestream alone.  Or there can be different
meetings.  Or people could watch recorded videos later.</p>
<p>The mental model here is “Watching TV together”.  We collectively watch
a show together.  There are periodic intermissions where each watching
community discusses among themselves and works on the exercises.
Everyone feels they are a part of something big and that keeps people interested.</p>
<p>We have clear communication channels from learner→instructor
(HackMD), helpers→instructors (chat), instructors→learners
(livestream).  Of course instructors can directly communicate with the audience
during their breaks.</p>
<p>The <strong>Director</strong> controls the stream and is responsible for keeping

<h3>Instructors<a class="headerlink" href="#instructors" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There is an <strong>instructor Zoom meeting</strong>.  This is broadcasted via
Twitch, using <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-obs"><span class="doc">OBS</span></a> (there is usually a separate director
or production manager for this, instructors don’t need to worry
themselves with this).</p>
<p>Compared to the classic style, advantages include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You are freed from student management, others help manage the
audience and convey these important parts to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Audio/video is muted during breaks, there is more opportunity to
discuss and plan what comes next with the instructors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You lose the direct access to all students (but how often would
someone speak up anyway?).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Instructors should keep in mind (many of these are not special to the
MOOC format, but are even more important):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>At all times you will have a director to help keep you on track:
just teach and watch chat (and HackMD when you have time, but others
do this and let you know).</p></li>
<li><p>You will have a private Zoom meeting with only instructors (and any
other key helpers who want to be there).</p></li>
<li><p>Share a vertical screen (840 × 1080 is our standard and your
maximum).  This allows students
to keep half of their screen open for their own work.</p></li>
<li><p>HackMD is the main way of receiving questions from students (just
like in our current courses).  The HackMD helper can be in the
main stream to immediately ask questions from the audience, or your
co-instructors could do this.  Really, perhaps both.</p></li>
<li><p>During breaks and pauses, the livestream will be muted, so that
instructors (and helpers there) can talk without the audience
hearing.  This greatly increases professionalism and makes it easier
to coordinate.</p></li>
<li><p>There is the standard text chat (Zulip) to use to communicate with
other helpers.</p></li>
<li><p>Of course, you can go join the student room during breaks, other
sessions, and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>Zoom polls won’t work, since the instructors and audience aren’t in
the same Zoom meeting.  This is one reason we already use HackMD for
polls (though there are other options, such as presemo.aalto.fi,
which could work in even larger courses).</p></li>
<li><p>You will have more than just the registered students in another room
as an audience.  Your audience includes students in the breakout
room meeting, livestream watchers, people in their own meetings with
a private team we don’t know about, people broadcasting it to
physical rooms, people watching recordings later, and who knows who
else.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Try to speak with awareness of this diverse audience.  You don’t
need to change much, but go slowly and give plenty of time, and
you can say things like “If you are registered, … .  If you are
on your own, … .”</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat back questions before answering them, so that people across
channels can follow.  This is a usually good idea anyway, and also
it is natural when questions are coming through chat or notes.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak in terms of breaks and exercises sessions.</p></li>
<li><p>Speak in terms of relative times, since people will be in different
timezones.  For example, say “We resume at
50 minutes past the hour” and write “xx:50”.</p></li>
<li><p>Realize there are different learning styles.  Some people will
attempt all exercises.  Some will passive watch and want demos.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We propose this general model for each lecture-exercise cycle:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Give the lecture part</p></li>
<li><p>Introduce the exercises</p></li>
<li><p>Short break (~5 minutes).  People attempting exercises themselves
go into their other meetings and work on it.  The learners
attempting it themselves will mute the stream.</p></li>
<li><p>On-stream, do the exercise as a type-along or demo.  This is useful
for some audience, and also is very useful in recordings.</p></li>
<li><p>At the designated time, the learners come back to the livestream.
Depending on what you want, you could use the outcome of the demo
to discuss what we learned, do a whole new demo (perhaps faster
this time), or you go on.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>You should also make it clear to the audience (mainly
helpers/team leaders) what the expectation for each exercise
session is.  This should be written in the HackMD!</p></li>
<li><p>It is OK to decide you can’t make things perfect for every audience.
The rest will understand this if you make this explicit.</p></li>

<h3>Director<a class="headerlink" href="#director" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You job is to be aware of everything going on, and when there is a
question like “Do we need more time?” or “what should we do now?”, you
can answer it.  You can give people the pushes when they get slightly
off track (though others should always be willing to speak up when
this is needed, too).  You maintain this awareness by watching as many
of the communication channels as you can.</p>
<p>Hint: find your computer’s detailed audio controls, so that you can
adjust volumes of multiple sources independently.  This helps you be
in multiple meetings at once.  (This may be useful for others that
want to attend multiple meetings.)</p>

<div class="section" id="expert-helpers-and-other-staff">
<h3>Expert helpers and other staff<a class="headerlink" href="#expert-helpers-and-other-staff" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>As a helper, your job stays pretty much the same.  There is more
emphasis on making sure that all questions and comments are in the
HackMD.</p>
<p>Some helpers can join the instructor meeting and directly relay
questions and thoughts, and in general provide the “voice of the
audience”.  This is a logical role for the HackMD helper.</p>

<h3>Audience and team leaders<a class="headerlink" href="#audience-and-team-leaders" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>

<h4>In the main meeting with breakouts<a class="headerlink" href="#in-the-main-meeting-with-breakouts" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Here, there is a meeting (e.g. Zoom) which has a lot of learners in
it.  There are two options for lectures:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Meeting host shares the livestream (video + audio)</p></li>
<li><p>Participants individually open the livestream and watch, and go back
to the meeting when it is time to do exercises.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All audience members ask questions and discuss in HackMD (just like in
regular workshops).  The meeting chat is mainly used for
practicalities, and is not designed to be monitored by the audience.</p>
<p>The most significant risk here is that learners have to mute the
livestream (or turn it off) during the exercise sessions if there are
demos going on while they are doing exercises.  This means we may have
trouble getting their attention.</p>

<p>Open Broadcaster Software is an amazing open-source audio/video

serious events and will make a non-professional feel professional.
The main point is that, instead of being limited to what your meeting
software can do, you can:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>create more advanced mixes of screens/video/etc, without having to
do post-processing.</p></li>

<dt>Twitch</dt><dd><p>A popular livestreaming site.  Popular with gamers, but has all
kinds of live-streaming events.</p>
</dd>
<dt>codec</dt><dd><p>COding and DECoding.  As a noun, the algorithm used to encode
and decode sound or video.  There are many different codecs,
with different properties of
compression, CPU usage, etc.  The codec is independent of the
program actually used to encode/decode, and also (somewhat, not
entirely) independent of the container format.</p>
</dd>
<dt>container format</dt><dd><p>File format that contains the audio/video data.  There are
different formats, and the container format is independent of
the codec of the material inside (but not all codecs work in all
containers).  There are containers for both streaming and
recorded media.</p>
</dd>
<dt>encoder</dt><dd><p>The program that compresses raw video to the codec for
distribution.  Of course, there are also decoders.  You need the
right decoder for each codec, but most things you would use
these days are widespread.</p>
</dd>
<dt>bitrate</dt><dd><p>Amount of data of the media stream over time.  Usually measured in
Megabits (not bytes, also note the actual unit is
Megabit/second).  As an example,
Netflix on mainstream “high” quality is about 5 Mbit, and Twitch
recommends ~6 Mbit at most.  Netflix on low quality is about .7
Mbit, but of course all these are for movies, not relatively
static screenshares.</p>
<p>The more movement in a scene, the more bitrate required to
encode that at a constant quality.</p>
</dd>
<dt>constant bitrate (CBR)</dt><dd><p>Encoding method where the bitrate does not vary over time.
There is only a small encoding buffer to handle times with a
large amount of movement.</p>
<p>Twitch and other live streaming sites recommend CBR because of
the way the Internet works.  With a live stream, a constant
stream of data is needed.  Internet congestion
control protocols can keep a constant stream going when the
stream is constant.  If
there is a sudden increase in instantaneous bitrate (with VBR
and a section with lots of movement), congestion control
not be able to keep up and buffers empty, causing lag.</p>
<p>Similar considerations apply to other playback modes, such as
embedded devices with limited CPU power, thus the idea of
encoding “targets” (profiles optimized for certain classes of
devices).  Mainstream personal computers tend to have enough
power to decode anything, so this isn’t a major consideration.</p>
</dd>
<dt>variable bitrate (VBR)</dt><dd><p>Encoding method where instantaneous bitrate varies depending on
how much information is needed at each instantaneous point of
time, to encode the complexity of the current scene.  In x264,
this is usually done as “CRF”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>latency</dt><dd><p>Time delay between two events.  In a livestream, time delay
between the performer’s actions and the audience seeing it.
This is caused by countless buffers: encoding buffer, network
buffers, network transmission time, decoding buffer, etc.  Lower
latency increases performance demands on the hardware and
network, so you need to strike a balance.</p>
<p>On Twitch, “low latency mode” gives you 10-15 seconds of latency.</p>
</dd>
<dt>x264</dt><dd><p>A common open-source encoder.  Used as an internal encodign
backend for many different programs.</p>
</dd>
<dt>x264 → crf</dt><dd><p>In x264, a variable bitrate encoding mode (constant rate
factor).  Values are between 0 and 51, but reasonable values are
low 20s.  For example, 23 is the default and looks good for all
practical purposes.</p>

<p>OBS is a graphical program.  Once you start it up, you see various
user interface features:</p>

<p>Of primary note are the following concepts:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Preview area</dt><dd><p>Shows what is currently being broadcasted or recorded, or will be
if you turn it on.  There is also a separate “Studio mode” with a
preview area, and live area.  The preview area is used to prepare
the stream, you can make it live when you want.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Scenes</dt><dd><p>A certain layout that can be broadcasted.  On the lower left is
your scene collection, and you can add, delete, reorder, and rename
scenes.  By clicking on a scene, you switch to it and it begins
broadcasting/recording.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Sources</dt><dd><p>An image source which can be composed together in a scene.  Scenes
can be added, deleted, recorded.  Via the preview area, sources can
be graphically moved around to your liking.  There is a
comprehensive set of positional and image effect transforms you can
make.</p>
<p>Sources can have <strong>filters</strong> applied to them, which do some sort of
video transformation (for example, background removal).  There are
also <strong>transformations</strong>, which affect the position in the scene.
Put together, you can do almost anything you would like.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Audio sources</dt><dd><p>You can take audio input from various sources: mainly, microphones
or as a monitor of a computer audio device (to, for example, play
sound).  Audio sources are configured in settings, but can be

<h3>Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Here, we will go over the main parts of configuration.  We won’t say
everything, since this is graphical program and you can mostly click
around and find your own customization you would like.</p>
<p>Because of the popularity of streaming, it is easy to find more
tutorials and recommendations for anything here.  Add “streaming” or
“OBS” to your search.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-configuration">
<h4>Basic configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-configuration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>These options are found in the “Settings” dialog.  These are just
generally suggested defaults and when you might want to tone them.</p>
<dl>
<dt>File → Settings → Stream</dt><dd><p>Here, you would configure the streaming service, if any.</p>
</dd>
<dt>File → Settings → Output</dt><dd><p>Here, you configure streaming/recording output parameters.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>Simple</strong>, you pretty much can’t go wrong.  If you are
mainly screensharing and don’t have much action video, you can
make the bitrate much lower, for example 1500 Kbps.  The slower
“encoder preset” is, the more CPU power that will be spent to get
that quality, so the less space it will use.  The better your CPU
is, the slower you can make it; “fast” to “slow” are reasonable.</p>
<p>If you use <strong>advanced</strong> you have more options:</p>
<p>Streaming: Rate control=CBR, 1500 Kbps, other options don’t matter
so much, defaults should be fine.  You can search for
recommendations online, but realize that most others stream
high-action games so their settings are much higher than you need.</p>
<p>Recording: Recording format, mkv (mp4 is completely unusable if
the recording dies, mkv can be uploaded to youtube if it has a
supported coder inside of it). Encoder=x264,
Rate control=CRF, CRF=22, Keyframe interval=auto, CPU
preset=medium (or slower, for better CPUs)
(slower=use more CPU to do better
encoding, either higher quality or lower bitrate.  Veryfast–Slow
is a good range),
Profile=main, Tune=None</p>
<p>If you use the streaming encoder for the recording, then it will
only have to encode it once and it will save CPU power.</p>
</dd>
<dt>File → Settings → Video</dt><dd><p>Here, you set the base size of the picture you will be using.
You could do FullHD at 1920x1080.  For vertical
recording, we recommend you do 840x1080.  Use your chosen value
for both Base and Output resolutions.  30 FPS.</p>
<p>When setting your video size, traditionally people tell you to be
as large as possible (to attract viewers).  However, this guide is
focused on teaching
and learning, and for that a) we want our content to be as
accessible as possible.  There is no need for as many pixels as
possible, as we often say “present from your smallest screen”, and
you can do that by artificially restricting yourself.  b) We have
found a vertical screen works well: a learner can have the
video/stream taking up half of their screen, and the other half
available for doing their own work.</p>

<p>Click around through the other menus in settings and see if there is

</div>
<div class="section" id="scene-configuration">
<h4>Scene configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#scene-configuration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>After the above, you can set up scenes basically however you would
like.  However, as a starting point I propose these scenes to get you
started (and I propose we standardize on these names, so that we
can make some uniform scripting tools):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Title</strong>, the logos and titles of the event.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gallery</strong>, a gallery of the people presenting (or the one).  When
presenting from a Zoom meeting, this is a capture of the gallery
view in dual-monitor mode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Local</strong> is a local screenshare, that you get by capturing your own
screen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Remote</strong> is a screenshare by someone remote.  If you are capturing
from a Zoom meeting, it is the capture of the second window of the
dual-monitor mode.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Notes</strong> is some HackMD or other material you might want to show
during discussion periods or breaks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Common types of sources (scene elements) include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Static image (e.g. logo or background)</p></li>
<li><p>Desktop capture, for your local desktop.  You can crop it (in the
source config) to share only a portion of your desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>Single-window capture.  Note that this is smarter than Zoom,
since it can capture the full window even if is not on top.</p></li>
<li><p>Text (which works, but is not very powerful)</p></li>
<li><p>Solid colors</p></li>
<li><p>Other scenes.  You can make one scene, then insert it into other
scenes to avoid duplication of scene elements scene elements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The sources themselves can be moved around graphically, which is good for
setting things up.  When there are more demanding needs, the source
transformation can be edited for more precise control (right click on
source in preview → edit transformation).  There are
source <em>filters</em>, which can do video effects such as removing a color.
Some sources can be cropped in the source-specific config as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="audio-configuration">
<h4>Audio configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#audio-configuration" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Audio configuration is simpler than video configuration, since there
are fewer different sources.  On the other hand, it is harder to
see what is going on (no preview) so it is harder to adjust it
perfectly, and easier to cause problems like loops.</p>
<p>The main concept is that your computer may have different input and
output sound devices (“cards”).  For example, I can output sound from
some application on my monitor’s speakers, while sound from other
applications on the headphones at the same time.  Find your computer’s
way to see and configure what is going on under the hood.</p>
<p>There are two types of audio inputs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Microphones</strong>, obviously recording from a microphone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Monitors</strong> (as in, monitor a sound card), recording what is
currently being played on another
sound card.  This is what is used to capture audio from a remote
meeting, such as Zoom.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You set the active audio input in the application settings.  The
volumes of these can be independently adjusted - you want typical
volume to be in the yellow zone.  Advice for various operating systems
include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Linux using PulseAudio: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pavucontrol</span></code> (GUI) or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pulsemixer</span></code>
(terminal)</p></li>
<li><p>Windows: ???</p></li>
<li><p>MacOS: ???</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Under “advanced audio properties” (a menu item, also available from
the gear icon in the audio area) you have several more options.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>You can add various filters, such as noise reduction.</p></li>
<li><p>You can group audio sources into various <strong>audio tracks</strong>, and the
stream/recordings can use different tracks.  For example, a person
may stream with music but leave that out of the recorded video.  Or,
you might record a video with two different audio tracks, one just
the presenter and one with presenter + audience.</p></li>
<li><p>You can monitor the audio, which plays what is being recorded back
over the headphones and speakers for you to check.  Make sure you
don’t make any loops!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Audio configuration is a big deal.  You can look at these other
guides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-instructor-tech-online"><span class="doc">Instructor technical setup, online</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>???</p></li>
</ul>
<p>High-quality audio is quite important.  I’ve spent far too long
playing with it, and my conclusion is that I don’t know enough to make
it better than what I have now.  What I know is in the “instructor
tech setup, online” page linked above.  I propose a central
recommendation: <em>talk about audio quality</em>.  Start meetings early and
test it.  Communicate about problems early, don’t ignore and think
it’s “good enough for now”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="recording-and-streaming">
<h4>Recording and streaming<a class="headerlink" href="#recording-and-streaming" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Once you have done the above, you can record and stream by clicking
the buttons.</p>
<p>One piece of advice: always keep the recording going, and then
stop/restart it when you need to cut.  It’s easier to delete the
unnecessary segments than realize you forgot to push “record”.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="projector-and-loopback-output">
<h4>Projector and loopback output<a class="headerlink" href="#projector-and-loopback-output" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h4>
<p>Beyond recording and streaming, there are several more ways to use the
output that can feed into other applications.</p>
<p>With <strong>projectors</strong> you can display the scene locally on another
monitor or window.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The <strong>fullscreen projector</strong> displays the scene to a monitor.  As
the name says, this could be used to send it to an external
projector or capture card via HDMI.  Or even preview locally, or
screenshared in an online meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>The <strong>windowed projector</strong> does similar, but makes a new window that
can be moved and resized.  This can be captured as a single-window
screenshare in an online meeting.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>loopback output</strong> creates a <strong>virtual camera device</strong>.  This
appears to other applications as a camera, just like the camera that
captures your video.
Other applications can use this as the input just like another
webcam.  So, you could make a fancy scene that is used instead of your
normal camera’s picture.
Or, in Zoom you can share screen from “second camera” -
which would use this scene.  (Note in Zoom it will interpret it as a
landscape picture, regardless of what aspect ration you actually use.
Thus, this isn’t very suitable for vertical screen sharing.)</p>

<h2>Lesson design<a class="headerlink" href="#lesson-design" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This is a checklist and hints when writing and designing a new lesson.
The master material is in Teaching Tech Together, primarily chapters 6
and 12 for practicalities and 2 and 4 for big picture considerations.
But really, all the book.  See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-teaching-tech-together"><span class="std std-doc">the summary we
made</span></a> or <a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/">the actual
book</a>.  The article <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006915">Ten quick tips for creating an
effective lesson</a> is
also a good summary of the main points.
Finally, the <a class="reference external" href="https://cdh.carpentries.org/">Carpentries Curriculum Development Handbook</a> gives practical information on how to design a new lesson and covers the entire lesson life-cycle with a good overview of the lesson release timeline.</p>
<p>This doesn’t replace your own knowledge in doing the actual teaching
part.  Instead, the first half gives pointers on making sure your
audience can connect to the material, and the last half gives hints
to help you come up with good exercises and examples.</p>
<div class="section" id="backwards-lesson-design">
<h3>Backwards lesson design<a class="headerlink" href="#backwards-lesson-design" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Think test-driven development: decide what you want students to be able
to do, design exercises to measure it, then fill in the gaps with
teaching.  You can see <a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/en/template/">their
summary</a>.  The steps are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Brainstorm what you want to cover.</p></li>
<li><p>Create or reuse learner personas - understand who you want to
teach.  What do they care about?  Perhaps as important is what they
don’t care about: make sure that you don’t go too in depth too
early and turn people off.</p></li>
<li><p>Create some summative assessments, that show what learners should
learn by the end.  Try to connect these to the learner personas.</p></li>
<li><p>Create formative assessments (exercises) that let the learners
practice what you want them to learn.  See below for hints on coming
up with good exercises.  These should also connect to things the
learners will actually do, but can also be more of checkpoints.</p></li>
<li><p>Put exercises in a logical order, and fill in any gaps.  Ideally
there should be 15-20 min of teaching between each exercise.  Perhaps
most are short (a few longer examples as needed), to identify a
certain learning goal and misconception.</p></li>
<li><p>Write just enough material to get from one exercise to the other.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The most important point here is to start from learner’s needs and how
they can feel connected, not from the tech details.</p>
<p>When advertising the course, connect it to your learner personas so
that you get the right audience and they know why they should come.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="emotional-and-intrinsic-appeal-other-basics">
<h3>Emotional and intrinsic appeal, other basics<a class="headerlink" href="#emotional-and-intrinsic-appeal-other-basics" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>You can think of why people should feel emotionally connected to your
material - maybe it’s too much to expect people to get emotionally
invested, but if you try for that, you’ll end somewhere better.</p>
<p>Try to design around tasks and exercises which your audience will care
about.  For example, don’t say “here are some shell commands”, but
“aren’t you tired of copying all of these files one by one… check
out the shell… once you know it, you will really feel at home.  Here
are some typical things you might do.”.  Intrinsic motivators include
<strong>sense of agency</strong> (being able to do things themselves), <strong>competence</strong>
(usefulness of what they are doing, feeling they know something), and
<strong>relatedness</strong> (doing things that others are doing).</p>
<p>A manual is reference, a tutorial builds a cognitive model.  If you
can build the cognitive model and tell them the “why”, students may be
able to refer to the manuals themselves and become self-sufficient.
Thus, teaching should be more of a
tutorial, with good links to manuals (it can also explicitly teach
how to use the manuals).</p>
<p>Perhaps a related point is inclusiveness: make sure there’s not some
“in” crowd.  Perhaps the best description I have seen: don’t assume
that some people are missing something, but that others have had the
fortune of learning it earlier.  This may not matter in a purely
factual lesson design, but if you are trying to make things
intrinsically or emotionally appealing, it is essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="who-is-the-audience">
<h3>Who is the audience?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-the-audience" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Making the <strong>learner personas</strong> are essential to making a good lesson,
even if you think you know who you are teaching to.  This is because
it grounds you into what your audience already knows (or doesn’t know)
and what they are interested in.</p>
<p>You also have different ways people can refer to the material:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In a class, with an instructor guiding them</p></li>
<li><p>Reading along by themselves</p></li>
<li><p>In a class, being much more advanced than others, so that they skip
ahead and do advanced material themselves.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="planning">
<h3>Planning<a class="headerlink" href="#planning" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do some planning, and <em>document it</em> - the design process helps
others to teach and modify.  At least put it in the README.  (this
is the <strong>designer/maintainer’s guide</strong>)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Put the main points from the “backwards lesson design process” in
here, enough that it is easier for someone to improve your lesson
than to redo it.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Make learner personas: what is your target audience?</p></li>
<li><p>Decide learning objectives based on the personas: high-level end
goals.  What students get out, not what they do.</p></li>
<li><p>Also make a <em>guide</em> for teaching (<strong>instructor’s guide</strong>), “if you
want to present this, do this”.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How much preparation is needed?  Is it enough to know the topic
and have read the material?</p></li>
<li><p>Things to prepare before the presentation.  Does anything need to
be set up?</p></li>
<li><p>Practical notes on presenting.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there solutions to exercises somewhere?  Are they needed?</p></li>
<li><p>Include some pre-assessment questions which can be asked at the
beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>Perhaps you should do this at the end, but at least starting the
instructor’s guide at the beginning will frame your writing.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="writing">
<h3>Writing<a class="headerlink" href="#writing" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There is not much here yet, mostly just follow the “backwards lesson design”
above.  The hardest part is coming up with good exercises, so our
practical advice is to mix and match from the two taxonomies at the
bottom and the exercise types.  Try to think of diverse types of
exercises.</p>
<p>Exercise design is the time it is most useful to be with others to do
brainstorming, so we highly recommend discussing with others at this
point.  Because exercises are used to set the overall outline of the
lesson, this also gives people a say in the overall outline - in a
very concrete way.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Make sure you include the emotional starting point at the beginning - why
should you care and why is this cool?</p></li>
<li><p>This should also be at the start and end of each section: not just what
or how, but why?</p></li>
<li><p>Part of this is also having a <strong>student’s guide</strong>, so that
people independently studying can know how to follow the material.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s OK to have more material than can be presented or than people
should know, but <em>label things well</em>, including <em>labeling the difficulty</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In the beginning, what sections are expected to be taught in
short/long versions?  What’s advanced/optional?</p></li>
<li><p>Label advanced and optional sections as such.  Perhaps also really
basic sections that can be skipped for that reason.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Plan for mixed abilities.  It’s OK to have optional (basic) and
advanced sections, as long as they are clearly labeled.  Mainly, don’t
have people think that you are uncoordinated because you are skipping
advanced sections.</p>
<p>Once you are done, update maintainer’s and instructor’s guides.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introduction-and-conclusion">
<h3>Introduction (and conclusion)<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-and-conclusion" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The introduction is the first thing people hear, and needs special
thought.  Don’t start with a cold open, just going straight to the
topic (“what” or “how”).  Instead, have some careful motivation
(“why”).  It could be especially good to talk about what is wrong with
the current state of affairs (give a good, simple example) and why it
should be improved.  Then start talking about what the improvements
are.</p>
<p>Ideally, the introduction should serve as an self-contained abstract
of your material.  If you need to teach your lesson in only 10% of the
time you have, can you use just the introduction to do it?</p>
<p>Conclusion should remind people about why this is cool and discuss
what comes next.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thinking-of-exercises">
<h3>Thinking of exercises<a class="headerlink" href="#thinking-of-exercises" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Not every exercise has to be an amazing hand-on example.  It’s mixing
with smaller, more conceptual things to reduce the cognitive load and
be able to have more frequent exercises.</p>
<p>One of your other primary goals should be to make your exercises
<em>relevant</em>.  Abstract will lead to disconnection. Connect the exercises
to the real world.  Also, can you tell a complete story with
exercises?  (Remember, in backwards lesson design, the exercises
form the story of the lesson.)</p>
<p>Remember that not every exercise has to be long.  Try to have
frequent short exercises to get immediate feedback, with some long
ones.</p>
<p>Good exercises are the most important factor in a good lesson.  Even
if you are preparing the rest of the lesson mostly alone, consider a
good long brainstorming session to go from “list of topics to cover”
to “sequence of exercises”.</p>
<p>When you are stuck thinking “how can I make an exercise that covers
X”, think of the lists below inspiration.  Not every exercise has to be an
sophisticated hands-on thing, so don’t be afraid to use different
types:</p>
<p>Basic types:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Multiple choice (easy to get feedback via a classroom tool - try to
design each wrong answer so that it identifies a specific
misconception).</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself (traditional programming)</p></li>
<li><p>Code yourself + multiple choice to see what the answer is (allows
you to get feedback)</p></li>
<li><p>Inverted coding (given code, have to debug)</p></li>
<li><p>Parsons problems (working solution but lines in random order,
learner must only put in proper order)</p></li>
<li><p>Fill in the blank</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More advanced:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tracing execution</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing values through code flow (e.g. what is the sequence of
values that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> takes on?)</p></li>
<li><p>Reverse execution (find input that gives an output)</p></li>
<li><p>Minimal fix (given broken code, make it work)</p></li>
<li><p>Theme and variations (working code, adapt to other type of
situation/problem)</p></li>
<li><p>Refactoring</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More conceptual:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Draw a diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Label diagram</p></li>
<li><p>Matching problem: two sets of Q/A, match them.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Thinking through the learning taxonomies also helps to come up with
diverse types of exercises:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Bloom’s taxonomy: hierarchical skill levels (can you help students
to “grow a level”?):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Remembering</p></li>
<li><p>Understanding</p></li>
<li><p>Applying</p></li>
<li><p>Analyzing</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluating</p></li>
<li><p>Creating</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Fink’s taxonomy: complementary types instead of hierarchical:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Foundational knowledge</p></li>
<li><p>Applications</p></li>
<li><p>Integration</p></li>
<li><p>Human dimension</p></li>
<li><p>Caring</p></li>
<li><p>Learning how to learn</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Remember to keep the <em>story</em> of the lesson in mind.  Many people are
focusing on the small matters (during every change), but only
occasionally do people look at the big pictures.  That’s why a proper

small things and possibly derailing the story.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://teachtogether.tech/">Teaching Tech Together</a> is a book
compiled by Greg Wilson which is about the pedagogy and practical
hints of teaching technology in informal environments.  It is a very
good resource, and the main point is that research does back up
teaching, it’s not all intuition.  Many citations are included.</p>
<p>This page contains a summary of the most important points.  The point
is that one can quickly refer to this before writing a new lesson or
teaching a course.  The article <a class="reference external" href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006915">Ten quick tips for creating an
effective lesson</a> is
also a good summary of the main lesson design points of this book.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Novice = no good mental model of what they are learning</strong>, “not even
wrong”</p></li>

<li><p>Cognitive load: too much is bad and makes learning slow</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Faded example</strong>: blank out certain things in an example which are
added as an exercise/example (what you want to progressively
teach).  Seeing examples is good, debugging as an example.</p></li>

<h3>Ch4: Cognitive load<a class="headerlink" href="#ch4-cognitive-load" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Cognitive load is divided into intrinsic load (background required
learn), germane load (mental effort to link new to old), and
extraneous load (everything else that distracts from learning).
(this is “cognitive load theory”)</p></li>
<li><p>A paper claimed that self-guided learning is less effective, because
people are overloaded: you have to both learn new facts and learn
how to use them at the same time.</p></li>
<li><p>Strategies: use exercises well that minimize tho load.  a) parsons
problems, b) labeled subgoals, c) split attention (separate
channels, but complimentary rather than redundant), d) minimal
manuals</p></li>

<h3>Ch6: A lesson design process<a class="headerlink" href="#ch6-a-lesson-design-process" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Backwards lesson design, similar to test-driven development: 1)
brainstorm ideas for what to cover, 2) create learner personas to
figure out who you want to teach, 3) create formative assessments to
give learners a chance to exercise what they are trying to learn
(3-4 per hour), 4) put formative exercises in order, 5) write the
teaching material around this.</p></li>
<li><p>Learner persons, to guide your design process: a) general
background, b) what they already know, c) what they <em>think</em> they
want to know, d) how course will help, e) special needs.</p></li>
<li><p>Learning objectives: write objectives and think of what depth of
understanding you are getting too.  Consider Bloom’s taxonomy: a)
remember, b) understand, c) apply, d) analyze, e) evaluate, f)
create.</p></li>
<li><p>Fink’s taxonomy (unlike Bloom’s, complimentary not hierarchical): a)
foundational knowledge, b) application, c) integration, d) human
dimension, e) caring, f) learning how to learn.</p></li>
<li><p>Maintainability: is it easier to update than replace?  a) <strong>You have to
document the lesson design process</strong>, b) technical collaboration, c)
are people willing to collaborate?  Or do teachers resample rather
than update?</p></li>

<h3>Ch8: Teaching as performance art<a class="headerlink" href="#ch8-teaching-as-performance-art" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Get feedback on your teaching.  People aren’t born teachers, and
feedback isn’t in the western teaching culture enough.</p></li>
<li><p>Use live coding.  It’s much more effective, especially because it’s
two way and <em>you can demonstrate making mistakes</em>.  a) embrace your
mistakes, b) ask for predictions, c) take it slow, d) be seen and
heard (stand + microphone), e) mirror your learner’s environment, f)
use the screen wisely (make it big enough), g) double devices (one
to present, one for notes), h) use diagrams, i) avoid distractions,
j) improvise after you know the material, k) face the screen only
occasionally</p></li>
<li><p>Drawbacks of live coding, which you can minimize over time: a) going
too slow, b) exercises can be too deep and have too much cognitive
load (give skeleton code).</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch9-in-the-classroom">
<h3>Ch9: In the classroom<a class="headerlink" href="#ch9-in-the-classroom" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Code of conduct: teaching isn’t for those that are already “in”,
it’s for those that aren’t.  If you don’t notice problems and
enforce it transparently, it means nothing though.</p></li>
<li><p>Peer instruction.  Discuss in groups.  e.g. multiple choice
question, if there is a wide variety of wrong answers, have them
discuss in groups.</p></li>
<li><p>Teach teaching: different strategies, consider what you want to do:
a) teach teaching (taking turns) b) teach and assist (going around
helping) c) alternative teaching (group with more specialized
instruction), d) teacher and observer, e) parallel teaching (two
groups, same material), f) station teaching (rotate through
stations).</p></li>
<li><p>If co-teaching, plan ahead: a) confirm roles at start, b) work out
some hand signals for common conditions, c) each person should talk
at least 10-15 min at a time, d) person who isn’t teaching shouldn’t
distract, though leading questions OK, e) check what your partner
will teach after you are done, f) inactive teacher stays engaged,
not doing own stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Plan for mixed abilities, especially false beginners who have
studied the material before.</p></li>
<li><p>Can you make a collaborative not online document?</p></li>
<li><p>Sticky notes</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t start from blank pages, give some starting point.

<h3>Ch10: Motivation and demotivation<a class="headerlink" href="#ch10-motivation-and-demotivation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Extrinsic vs intrinsic motivation.  Extrinsic: have to do it for job
or something.  Intrinsic: do it for self, you want to encourage
intrinsic motivation.  Drivers of intrinsic motivation: a)
competence, b) autonomy, c) relatedness (connection to others).</p></li>
<li><p>Consider usefulness and time to master.  Focus on useful and fast.
Useful = <em>authentic tasks</em>, things people will actually use.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid demotivation: for adults, a) unpredictability, b)
indifference, c) unfairness.  Specific examples: a) contemptuous
attitude, b) saying existing skills are worthless, c) complex or
detailed technical discussion, d) pretending you know more than
they do, e) the word “just” as in, it’s “just easy”, f) software
installation problems, g) giving impossible challenges to fail at to
try to learn something, if not understanding.</p></li>

<li><p>The chapter has various good ideas, including how to make sure
everyone is heard (certain group doesn’t dominate online
discussions), short cycles and short exercises, require some small
group work, use videos to engage rather than instruct (people can

coding (given code, test and debug), fill in the blanks, Parsons
problems (given questions but in wrong order).</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing execution, tracing values, reverse execution (find input for
output), minimal fix, theme and variations, refactoring exercise.
Pen and paper exercises.</p></li>
<li><p>Diagrams and connection: draw diagram, label diagram, matching
problems.</p></li>

<h3>Become an instructor<a class="headerlink" href="#become-an-instructor" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We are always looking for new instructors for our main tools workshop happening twice a year in spring/autumn. For these workshops, we always have two instructors per topic and provide an instructor onboarding before the workshop when needed. We have gathered a lot of information and guides about “how to instructor at a CodeRefinery workshop”, but the main aspects are summarized in our <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#document-instructor-intro"><span class="doc">Instructor introduction</span></a>.</p>

<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://coderefinery.zulipchat.com">CodeRefinery zulipchat</a> is
where our primary discussion, planning, and action takes place.  Many
things are announced only via zulipchat.  This is a public chat and
everybody is welcome to join, no invitation needed, and we explicitly
invite anyone to give ideas in any thread.</p>
<p>The chat is a joint community of CodeRefinery (teaching), NordicHPC
(infrastructure), and Nordic-RSE (usage and software), which are other
Nordic projects about scientific computing which share some of the
same people.  Together, we have a network of all aspects of modern
scientific computing.</p>
<p>Unlike Slack, zulipchat is very heavily threaded, and it is easy to
follow along without being active all the time.  Respond within the
topic (=thread) that is relevant, or make a new thread.  Sometimes you
can find old threads to revive.  Don’t worry, everything is flexible
and you’ll quickly learn by watching (and don’t worry about going
wrong).</p>
<div class="section" id="streams">
<h3>Streams<a class="headerlink" href="#streams" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Once you join the chat, you will be subscribed to some default
streams (a stream is basically a channel).  <strong>The first thing you
should do is join some more streams, depending on your interest.  Join
more streams by clicking gear icon by the steams list on the left side
on that chat, then selecting what you are interested in.</strong></p>
<p><img alt="Gear icon to join a stream" src="_images/chat--join-stream.png" /></p>
<p>If you <strong>mute a stream</strong>, you can see the contents if you click on it,
but you won’t get notifications.  If you <strong>mute a topic</strong>, it will be
hidden from view but you can later unmute it in your personal
settings.  Under stream settings, you can request email notifications
for all messages in a certain stream (possibly useful for the announce
streams).</p>

<div class="section" id="reacting-and-voting">
<span id="voting"></span><h3>Reacting and voting<a class="headerlink" href="#reacting-and-voting" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>We want everyone to take part in chat and express their thoughts, but
of course people don’t want to give pointless agreeing replies (but
you can always welcome to do that, too).  So, we encourage everyone to
use reactions in cases they want to express agreement/disagreement but
not so much they want to send a message.  Common reactions you might
see are 👍, 👎 (thumbs up/down, agree with general sentiment), 🐙
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:octopus:</span></code>, awesome/amazing/ace), and well, plenty more that are
obvious.</p>
<p>We also use reactions to express some idea of a more concrete
<strong>vote</strong>, to empower people to take an action (otherwise, it is
difficult to get a decision on anything).  This is not formal or
necessarily binding (so it’s not really a vote), but a useful
intermediate system for a young project.  If you see a message
proposing something and you want to say, in no uncertain terms, “I
think you should do that” or not, let us know by the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>↔️ (+0, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:left_right:</span></code>: I see this and am neutral.</p></li>
<li><p>🔼, 🔽 (+1, -1, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:upvote:</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:downvote:</span></code>) or similar: I
agree/disagree with this.</p></li>
<li><p>⏬, ⏫ (+2, -2, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:double_up:</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:double_down:</span></code>): I agree/disagree
with this and am willing to work on making it happen/finding an
alternative.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to do something, ask for opinions, and a reasonable time
later it seems the sentiment is positive, consider yourself empowered
to do it.  If you are voting, feel free to be creative with emojis or
numbers, but realize that other reactions may not be so explicit.  Note
that if you are negative, you should explain why or alternatives,
otherwise your opinion may not be weighted so much.  The person doing
the thing decides what to do (and this is open source: we find a way
for everyone to do what they need to do).</p>
<p>Do you think you aren’t important enough to vote?  That’s wrong,
because we are usually interested in the thoughts of outsiders.  We
can see who voted and use that to weight our decision if needed.</p>

<h3>Privacy<a class="headerlink" href="#privacy" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>

<p>CodeRefinery is an open-source project.  All our work is open, and we
accept any type of contributions: there is a lot more than instructing
to run a successful workshop.  Also, CodeRefinery is really more of a
group of like-minded people than one particular plan, so you are
welcome to join just to hang out and share ideas.</p>
<p>If you aren’t sure you are ready for more, you can always <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#chat"><span class="std std-ref">lurk in the chat</span></a>
(passively watch our community) and become more active when you feel
the time is right.</p>
<p>These manuals (and in general, other guides we have) describe the
past, not (only) the future.  They are made so that new people can
know what we typically have done, so they can work on the future (even
if it’s different).</p>
<p>A good way to get started is to take the lead of some workshop (doing
it like it was before), then do it again with your own improvements.</p>

<p>We hope to acknowledge all contributors to our material, but there are
many different sizes of contributions to something as wide-ranging as
CodeRefinery.  We have these levels of credit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Editors</strong> take an overall, long-term view, set the overall
strategy, and manage the fit of the various sections.  They merge
pull requests (but so can others).</p></li>

significant to one part of the lesson, and take responsibility for
what they have added (along with the team).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Acknowledgees</strong> have made other contributions.</p></li>

<p>Editors and contributors are listed in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CITATION.cff</span></code> file within

you contribution is enough: the threshold is not high.  If so,
consider:</p>

to 0.5 full-time equivalent of their primary jobs).  Most of these
staff are from some sort of computing center.</p>
<p>Over time, it has evolved into a more open project direction.</p>

<div class="section" id="governance">
<h3>Governance<a class="headerlink" href="#governance" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>There is a steering group within NeIC which governs the CodeRefinery
project.  However, strictly speaking that mainly covers activities done
via NeIC funding.  The materials and open-source project is open to all.</p>
<p>There are currently no formal decision making processes.  Typically,
decisions related to some repository go through the process of…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Submit an issue or pull request</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss in the issue and/or</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss in a CodeRefinery team meeting</p></li>
<li><p>If there is rough consensus, then commit it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In general, most decisions (of the open project) result in some sort
of commit in git.  If the reaction is positive in a CodeRefinery
meeting, then it’s accepted.  (Most day-to-day things aren’t discussed
in the meetings, only major things affecting the whole project.)
In general, if you are open and discuss, then do what will improve the
project for you.</p>

<h2>Outreach plan<a class="headerlink" href="#outreach-plan" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This is a prototype the CodeRefinery outreach and marketing plan.</p>
<p>Since most of us are not very good at marketing, this is actually a
summary of the book <em>The new rules of marketing and PR : how to use
content marketing, podcasting, social media, AI, live video, and
newsjacking to reach buyers directly</em> (David Meerman Scott, 8th ed.)
with descriptions of how it can apply to CodeRefinery.  The book is
available at my university’s O’Reilly Online Learning platform through
our library for free.  If you like what you read here, consider
checking it out - the book was a very good inspiration for someone
that needs to outreach better, but is not at all that kind of person
and needs some inspiration for how to even think about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps this summary is useful to others outside of CodeRefinery as
well.</p>
<p>Currently, this page is one person’s description and their own
interpretation9 as it applies to CodeRefinery.  Over time, it should
be adapted to represent a broader view, this paragraph updated,
possibly the current content archived, and the new plan made into a
new page.</p>
<div class="section" id="introduction">
<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Many people need marketing and outreach: CodeRefinery isn’t trying to
sell things, but we are trying to encourage people to make a choice to
gain skills.  It’s free, but it does have a cost: time.  We think that
it does save more time in the long run, but then again, how many
businesses sell things that will save money in the long run?</p>
<p>We need to encourage people to make a specific choice, and we need to
tell them why we think that is the best choice for them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-old-rules-of-marketing-and-pr-are-ineffective-in-an-online-world">
<h3>1 The Old Rules of Marketing and PR Are Ineffective in an Online World<a class="headerlink" href="#the-old-rules-of-marketing-and-pr-are-ineffective-in-an-online-world" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>“Interruption advertising” doesn’t work (anymore?).  Few people want
to have their life interrupted with a TV commercial, banner ad, or
email from university administrators telling them to make some
choice.  People think of different things now.</p>
<p>For CodeRefinery, you could argue that flyers, emails from university
staff, etc. are all some form of interruption advertising.</p>
<p>There’s all kind of anecdotes about how advertisement, mentions in the
press, and so on aren’t useful, but we wouldn’t do those anyway.
Although, we do want press, that’s not the main way we get people to
take our courses.  (maybe it helps our funding, though)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-new-rules-of-marketing-and-pr">
<h3>2 The New Rules of Marketing and PR<a class="headerlink" href="#the-new-rules-of-marketing-and-pr" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>People do, however, take recommendations from people they know.  Social
media lets people communicate.  The match is clear.  By making good
use of social media, we can reach people directly.</p>
<p>(this chapter starts off with an example of social media inspiring the
author to visit Saariselkä in Finnish Lapland, which was interesting
to see.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reaching-your-buyers-directly">
<h3>3 Reaching Your Buyers Directly<a class="headerlink" href="#reaching-your-buyers-directly" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Social media lets people reach buyers directly.  This is obvious.</p>
<p>But, how to use social media.  You don’t want to go doing interruption
advertising, trying to use it to directly sell your stuff.  Instead,
produce good, free content which people will want to consume.  Most of
your activity should be about this, which gets people interested, and
makes them want more.  Then, when they want to go deeper or are ready
to make a purchase, they come to you.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery does nothing but make free content, so how does this
apply to us?  Well, we have to think more.  Our main content costs a
lot of time, so we need to think of content that is shorter and easier
to consume.  For example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Short videos or pictures explaining things.</p></li>
<li><p>Short blog posts about tips or tricks, which have a clear, catchy,
immediately useful title.</p></li>
<li><p>Tweeting links to specific pages we have just made, which are
especially useful standalone.</p></li>
<li><p>Short “git hacks” or clever things, which people like and share, and
makes them want to attend a workshop.</p></li>
<li><p>“Research software minute” videos?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>You have to think of buyer personas - backwards design all of your
material.  Don’t make anything unless you know who it is for, and then
make sure it is suitable for that person.  Know their goal, how they
speak, and where they are (what content do they consume?).</p>
<p>CodeRefinery buyer personas could include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Learners</p></li>
<li><p>team leaders</p></li>
<li><p>Group leaders or university staff who can recommend their audience
to attend a workshop</p></li>
<li><p>Prospective instructors and helpers</p></li>
<li><p>Funders and high-level leadership</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>4 Social Media and Your Targeted Audience<a class="headerlink" href="#social-media-and-your-targeted-audience" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Descriptions of what social media is.  A somewhat useful metaphor is
that the web is like a city.  Social media are things like bars or
cafes.  You don’t go there and start asking people to do something or
offering free samples and expect people to like it.  You network,
talk, maybe tell some interesting stories.  Maybe someone figures out
who you are and would want to know more about what you do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-contentrich-website">
<h3>5 The Content‐Rich Website<a class="headerlink" href="#the-contentrich-website" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Websites matter - people will go there and check it out.  Blogs are
good, they last longer than any single social media operator and
provide long-term web traffic.  Websites (and everything) need
specific skills and a manager.  The website needs a personality and
voice.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery should make sure that there is are clear target pages or
sections for each of our target personas below.  We should make sure
we don’t use jargon that we would use, or have the website organized
by our own operations as opposed to learner personas.  We should also
make sure the website is accessible and mobile-friendly.</p>

<h3>6 Marketing and PR in Real Time<a class="headerlink" href="#marketing-and-pr-in-real-time" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Following social media in real time can let you know what people
think.  This can be an even better feedback method than surveys, etc.
By responding in real time (this can take effort), you can have
conversations there (in the open) which is also very good for
outreach.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery could consider monitoring more of social media.  TODO:
how to do this?</p>

goes off into details of the implementation next.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Understand what we want.  Until a goal is clear, it is hard to

it). (CR: we could say “better science” but it can also mean things
like “attend workshops” or “ensure funding for the project”)</p>

<li><p>What do we want them to do?</p></li>
<li><p>What content do they consume?</p></li>

<li><p>How do they speak, talk, and read?</p></li>
<li><p>Subscribe to and follow the media they follow.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Develop (free) content that interests each of these buyers.</p></li>
<li><p>Develop a measuring plan.  Think about how we can measure success,
both in immediate engagement and making the decision we want (what
we actually want).</p></li>

<h3>9 Growing Your Business: How Marketing and PR Drive Sales<a class="headerlink" href="#growing-your-business-how-marketing-and-pr-drive-sales" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Salespeople don’t mediate between buyers and companies anymore.
Instead, people can find so much information themselves, and make
purchases self-service.  Websites and other material have to be target
to buyers (= potential learners) who are deciding if they want to
purchase (= attend a course).  Websites and material should have a
personality (= our website shouldn’t be written as boring as a
scientific paper).  It’s OK to do fun things.  Social aspects to the
site is good - e.g. comments section, social media share buttons.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Begin with informational content (not necessarily about you).</p></li>
<li><p>Nudge towards what you want (= attend a course, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Make it easy to close the deal. (CR: clear “notify me” mailing list
link on every relevant page.  Maybe even make sure we have
continually open registration for the next workshop - each workshop
is ready for registration when the previous one ends.  When we have
multiple types of workshops, includeable html snippets that has links
to register for every upcoming workshop?)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Don’t underestimate the value of figurehead leaders (~=CEOs) being
social - don’t just delegate it to separate marketers.</p>
<p>Is the analogy of salespeople even relevant for CodeRefinery?
Probably not, but maybe we could say that official requirement,
recommended courses, university staff aren’t so important.  People
will check our websites and other material to see if they want to
attend.</p>
<p>Every website, lesson, and so on has to have very clear information
targeted to a possible reader right at the beginning, so that a
potential learner might see “is this git lesson right for me?” and
they will find “yes”.</p>
<p>Our website should be current.</p>

<div class="section" id="strategies-for-creating-awesome-content">
<h3>10 Strategies for Creating Awesome Content<a class="headerlink" href="#strategies-for-creating-awesome-content" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This section has different strategies and types of content.  Types of
content include: blogs, audio, video, photos, infographics, charts,
email newsletters, presentations, long-form written content, research
reports, virtual events, e-books, white papers, apps.</p>
<p>Think about how you make the content: don’t just write about
yourself.  Consider the problems your buyers face and make content
that solves those problems.  Write for your personas.  Advertise what
you do.  Think what could possibly go viral.  Don’t forget that it
should be accessible.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery: in addition to the above, we should take part in other
events, for example show up at Open Science days and give
presentations, various awareness weeks (in person or online?),
conference hashtags, etc.</p>

<h3>11 How to Write for Your Buyers<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-write-for-your-buyers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Write like your buyers talk (we’ve said this before), and don’t use
pointless jargon or meaningless words to make you sound smarter.
Humor is OK.  Think like a journalist (especially for some content
types).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="social-networking-as-marketing">
<h3>12 Social Networking as Marketing<a class="headerlink" href="#social-networking-as-marketing" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Facebook pages, Facebook groups.  Linkedin profiles, companies, etc.
There are many more, but think about what is right for you, don’t do
something just because it is there.  Consider your personal brand -
make sure your profile information says something.  There is a
recommendation 85% sharing and engaging, 10% original content, 5%
promoting yourself.  Social media is like exercise: you need to make
it part of your routine, or you will stop doing it.  It can easily
take an hour per day.</p>
<p>For CodeRefinery, we know we should be more active on Twitter, which
seems like the most suitable network for us.  Are there any types of
badges we can use for professional social networks?  Can we declare
hashtags and publish them on our website permanently, so we don’t have
to decide them for every workshop?</p>
<p>Most people in CodeRefinery seem to be hesitant to use social network
sites heavily, for good reason.  We should really encourage and
support those who do want to use them to do so on our behalf, as much
as possible.</p>

<div class="section" id="blogging-to-reach-your-buyers">
<h3>13 Blogging to Reach Your Buyers<a class="headerlink" href="#blogging-to-reach-your-buyers" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Blogs are very important - and unlike social networks, they stay under
your control long-term, and drive search traffic straight to you.
Consider who you want to reach - potential learners?  existing
learners?  other thought leaders?  Blog about things that they are
interested in and you are passionate about.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to monitor other blogs from people who do similar things,
to keep up to date with what is going on.  Comment on other blogs and
link back to you.  Invite other bloggers to visit you and blog about
their experiences - this is good for both of you.</p>
<p>CodeRefinery probably knows that it should blog more.  Some ideas
about what to blog about are in previous sections.  We should make it
easier to share posts, and would we even want to try for a commenting
feature (might be too much, though…).</p>
