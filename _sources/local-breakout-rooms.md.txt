# Local breakout rooms

Some CodeRefinery courses are designed to be large scale, with
distributed registration.  In short, this means there is a livestream
that anyone in the world can watch.  Since we can't handle a
registration and personal support for everyone in the world, *you* can
open registration to attend the course.



## Principles

- We have a livestream, open to everyone in the world.  The
  {doc}`coderefinery-mooc` strategy allows us to reach a huge audience
  in a decentralized manner.

  - If courses don't have a livestream, we can still reach many people
    because of HackMD and teams.  From the list below, steps 2b and 2c
    work with this option.

  Decentralized teaching allows us to reach many more people than
  we could otherwise.
  ```

- Most attendees can ask from help through HackMD
  ({doc}`hackmd-mechanics`), which works very well
- There are periodic exercise sessions, where learners and teams can
  work together.


## Step 1: Local breakout room

- Create your own breakout room - whether online or a physical space.
  That means for example ask some friends to join you to watch the stream
  and collaborate with the exercises.
- Our exercise sessions are very clearly announced and communicated.
  During these times, the livestream goes silent, and you can work
  within your breakout rooms.  The end of the exercise sessions and
  breaks are clearly communicated as well - we support your breakout
  room scheduling as much as possible.
- Attendees can ask general questions via {doc}`HackMD
  <hackmd-mechanics>`
- You can continue your local support even after the course.
- You may want to run local "installation help" sessions.


## Step 2: Registration

- If you have a broad audience, you may want to make your own
  registration form, completely separated from ours. That may help
  with reservations and catering if any.
- Please have everyone to register in our form anyway 
  to help us in reporting our impact.
- You may (but don't have to) create **teams**, where you have one
  team leader for 5-6 learners.  The team leader guides the
  team and supports collaboration and community - and lets us scale
  much better than we could otherwise.  Teams also support retention
  after the course, especially if they knew each other before
  registering. (See {doc}`team-leaders`)
- We would like to know statistics from how many people attended from
  your location for our impact reports.  (still, the top priority is
  reaching as many people as possible, we'll adjust reporting to what works)


## Step 2b: Joint registration

- You can direct people to our registration form as a matter of
  simplicity, but we add an option for your institution.
- Learners join our Zoom session, and we create a breakout room for
  your institution and direct all learners there.
- Since you provide help to your own learners, we can more easily
  scale than we could otherwise.


## Step 2c: Joint registration, you provide team leaders for your teams

- A lot like "joint registration", but for workshops where we
  centrally organize teams.
- You locally recruit {doc}`team leaders <team-leaders>` for your
  own learners.  This saves us the effort of recruiting exercise
  leaders and allows us to scale more.


## Summary

As you can see, there are many models, from distributed and simple to
centralized.  It's best to talk in chat and see what will work best
for each workshop, but we are generally biased towards more
decentralized approaches for large courses.
