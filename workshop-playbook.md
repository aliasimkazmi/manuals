# Workshop checklist template

This page is a check list that we use when planning a CodeRefinery workshop
with 300 or more participants.
This is meant to be copied to a HackMD – hence the formatting.

Detailed role descriptions are in the role pages.

> This may be useful in organizing other workshops as well.

Let's keep this brief and copy-paste-able to HackMD/HedgeDoc for the actual planning.
